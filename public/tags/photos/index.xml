      <title>Added Additional Photos</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I added some additional photos in both the Family section as well as my personal photos..  My additions to the personal photo section chronicle more of my early youth.  Man am I getting sentimental these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added an additional photo of my father to the Family section of him on his beloved Farm-All-B (sp) tractor.  This was a few years before he passed away.  I will have many more photos to post later this weekend and in the coming weeks.  I plan to digitize many of the photos that I have around the house and in the photo albums.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have much that is current, though, as we all hated having our pictures taken, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be much from later in my parent&amp;rsquo;s life or many that show me the way that I am today.  So go ahead and enjoy these pictures and I ask that if you have any other photos of any of us, please sent them and I&amp;rsquo;ll scan them in and post them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have been using my Canon MP530 copier/scanner/fax machine to scan the pictures.  This device will allow me to scan several items at a time and then automatically crop out each individual picture for me.  I may tweak the settings on some of the future photos to increase the DPI somewhat, but for the purpose of posting them to the web, there won&amp;rsquo;t be much appreciable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, thanks to everyone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Family Photo Album</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, as I promised I have (or will have) posted more photos from my family - primarily of my mother and father - and most from before my time.  For the memorial service, I picked a smattering of photos for the viewing.  However, I missed the &amp;ldquo;treasurelode&amp;rdquo; of pictures contained in a different bedroom and closet that I think are much better.  So please reminisce over these photos and help fill in the blanks on when and where some of these places were.  I will cherish the memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family photo album will be found in the Picasa Photo Stream listed in the menu above. And if you have more photos, please forward them on to me and I will scan and post them for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

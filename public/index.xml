      <title>Site Update - Summer 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not forgotten about the blog.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with school and work, and also am attempting to move the blog from Jekyll to either Pelican (Python) or Hugo (Go).  I&amp;rsquo;m much more familiar with those languages than I am with Ruby (Jekyll).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also had to make an update to move my audio and graphical assets away from google storage to Amazon S3.  My audio may get moved again if the download of the files will cause a great increase in cost.  I&amp;rsquo;ll update soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is (most) of the music from the Comal Community Band Concert for the Music Study Club held at Cross Lutheran Church Gym on February 12, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocals were performed by CCB member Jacob Cantu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comal Community Band 2014 Stage Theatre</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/media/comal-community-band-2014-stage-theatre/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo; type of music posting.  On December 7, 2014, the Comal Community Band performed it&amp;rsquo;s annual Christmas Concert at Stage Theatre in Bulverde, TX..  However, since this is an open house event, it gets pretty loud.  So my normal recordings do not actually work for this event.  However, I was testing out the camera in my phone while on stage and took some videos of 5 songs from the Christmas half of the presentation (there are two parts - the first is normal non-Christmas music, then an intermission, then a Christmas music finale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazzy Christmas:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Longhorn Alumni Band 2014</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/longhorn-alumni-band-2014/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/longhorn-alumni-band-2014/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 18, 2014, I participated in the 51st Annual Longhorn Alumni Band Reunion at the Texas vs Iowa State.  This was the first time I have participated in the last 10 years (I used to always do it from 1995-2002, but dropped out afterwards).  This completes one item from my Ultimate Quest List for 2014-2015 (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/28/the-road-ahead-(cnf-part-2)/&#34;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the Ultimate Quest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this event, I decided to do a couple of videos.  Three of the videos are from me and two are from other people.  I also have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://picasaweb.google.com/105235561941690126130/LonghornAlumniBand2014&#34;&gt;photo gallery&lt;/a&gt; posted at Picasa (and available from the menu above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that the videos were &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; made with a GoPro.  I used my simple camera which does film in HD mode.  This camera was mounted to my tuba with a flexible camera mount.  I was surprised at how stable it was.  Either that, or I remembered how to keep my upper body stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first video is what halftime looks like from my perspective.  I was on the North 15 Yard Line leading a curl from the East sideline.  &lt;strong&gt;Note for those of you who have never experienced marching band, the phasing issues you hear while I am marching is common and due to how sound echoes back in the stadium.  At first, it seems disorienting, but you do get used to it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe
  width=&#34;560&#34;
  height=&#34;315&#34;
  src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ugNnBzQ-9Po&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was funny is that I was not the only person to do this.  A snare drummer also strapped a camera on and video taped halftime.  I say this is funny because we were on the same line and I can see him and his camera from my video and he can see me and my camera from his.  So here is his video for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe
  width=&#34;560&#34;
  height=&#34;315&#34;
  src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ColoxyOBOrw&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next video was the march from Music Building East to the Stadium including the Ramp Climb from hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe
  width=&#34;560&#34;
  height=&#34;315&#34;
  src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fsx4X3py7VQ&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next video was my recording of the Longhorn Band Pre-Game show.  Please excuse my &amp;ldquo;sucky&amp;rdquo; singing.  Not used to people actually singing Deep in the Heart of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe
  width=&#34;560&#34;
  height=&#34;315&#34;
  src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/rSWF4OmicKA&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final video is of the entire halftime show taken by someone in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe
  width=&#34;560&#34;
  height=&#34;315&#34;
  src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/I_ZGFUVL4PU&#34;
  frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
  allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I do it again?  Yes.  I had fun.  It was good exercise.  I will try to get more people that I know to go too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Camp Nerd Fitness Post-Mortum</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/fitness/camp-nerd-fitness-post-mortum/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/fitness/camp-nerd-fitness-post-mortum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first of two posts that I hope will chronicle my experiences at the most awesome event that I attended between September 18-21, 2014 at a camp nestled in the mountains of northern Georgia.  This inaugural event was held by Steve Kamb and the crew at the website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdfitness.com&#34;&gt;NerdFitness&lt;/a&gt; plus some awesome teachers who educated and motivated us to be the best person physically and mentally that we can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/28/the-road-ahead-(cnf-part-2)/&#34;&gt;Part 2 - The Road Ahead is here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Nerd Fitness?  I think it is fairly summarized well by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2014/09/15/the-oath-of-the-nerd-fitness-rebellion/&#34;&gt;Nerd Fitness Oath&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Nerd Fitness Rebel, and today is the first day of the rest of my life.  I shall make no excuses and hold no grudges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care not where I came from, only where I am going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t compare myself to others, only to myself from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall not brag about successes nor complain about my struggles, but share my experiences and help my fellow Rebels. I know I impact those around me with my actions, and so I must move forward, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge fear, doubt, and despair, but I do not let them defeat me. I pledge my life and honor for the Rebellion, for this day and all the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides all of the awesome articles written by Steve, there is an active community of &amp;ldquo;Rebels&amp;rdquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://rebellion.nerdfitness.com&#34;&gt;The Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.  (In the forums, I am &lt;a href=&#34;http://rebellion.nerdfitness.com/index.php?/user/29381-wxstormer/&#34;&gt;wxstormer&lt;/a&gt;).  For a small fee, there is also another group known as the Nerd Fitness Academy for more intensive discussions and help along the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did I like the weekend?  Like most of the other participants, I think it was the best weekend of my life.  I wonder why I struggled with the decision to actually attend.  I wavered for a few months - should I go or should I stay?  It took my last hospital stay to throw me into the &amp;ldquo;should I go&amp;rdquo; side.  For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, I need to lose a fairly substantial amount of weight to have a surgery that should hopefully fix the issue that has been causing me to spend so much time in the hospital for the past three years.  Plus I hate the way that I look.  Those were the motivating factors that caused me to commit to going on the trip and to join the Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my fitness journey, I have a goal to lose just about 150 pounds since my starting weight just under 400 pounds at the end of March 2014.  I have lost almost 50 pounds in the subsequent months and still have about 100 more to lose.  So my first fear to conquer was flying.  I have not flown anywhere for about 6 years, so I was concerned about what my experience would be flying on the plane.  So I&amp;rsquo;m happy to note that I was able to fly to and from Atlanta on Delta using the provided seat belt (no extender necessary).  That was awesome.  But then the hard part started.  I&amp;rsquo;m an Aspie and I have trouble being in social situations.  So once I landed in Atlanta, I found the group waiting to board the shuttle and kept circling it and thinking &amp;ldquo;should I&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;.  This is a classic problem for me.  Generally I answer &amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; and go hide in a corner and try to blend into the background.  However this trip was designed by me to force me past by barriers and to push me way beyond my comfort zone.  I found that the article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdfitness.com/web/20130517030436/http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/01/20/why-you-need-to-do-sh-that-scares-you/&#34;&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; That Scares You&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; is the tactic that I used for the weekend (&amp;ldquo;Stuff&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t the word that is in the article, but this is a family friendly blog) as well as some Social Skills and Confidence articles from the Academy.  So I picked and chose my place and entered the group.  It was hard but worth the effort.  I found that everyone was welcoming and friendly.  Crisis-averted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Shuttle Crowd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.willbyington.com/img/s6/v142/p1009559601-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;First Shuttle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp was held at Camp Ramah Darom located to the northwest of Clayton, GA nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wDyNm6u5z7KcHsQLe2tpxtAblKq3ViezwXpYdfkcpq4&#34; alt=&#34;Camp Headquarters&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition Lessons - Anthony Mychal taught a beginner Nutrition Class and June (Nerd Fitness Staff) taught a Paleo Meal Planning and a Basic Cooking Class.  Staci (Nerd Fitness) did a class on how complicated our relationships can be with food and how to overcome our difficulties with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pyschological Classes - Amy Clover presented a &amp;ldquo;Depression and Exercise&amp;rdquo; class in how to best overcome negative thoughts.  She also presented a &amp;ldquo;Body Image and Self Esteem&amp;rdquo; class that has continued to the present day to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/jeffreycentex/posts/10152500539772912&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on my Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Beginner Bodyweight class taught by Steve Kamp (and helped by Taylor Share) teaching the proper way to do BodyWeight Squats, PushUps, and Arm Rows (and a little bit of special training on Planks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big 4 Lifts taught by Staci that taught us the basics of weight lifting including proper form for bench press, bar squats, and the deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobility classes taught by Kate and Anthony.  Kate&amp;rsquo;s class was more catered to Yoga and Anthony&amp;rsquo;s was a reinforcement to Steve&amp;rsquo;s BodyWeight class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempted the bootcamp on Saturday morning.  Although I can only handle a few minutes of Amy&amp;rsquo;s HIIT bootcamp, it was awesome and makes me want to strive to be able to fully do it next year.  I will be doing her bootcamp in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stronginsideouttour.com/austin/&#34;&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; later this month, but I will probably only be a little more successful in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of talking with my fellow campers over lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attended the costume party as a character from the Game of Thrones (as best as I could be).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observed the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube costume party, but didn&amp;rsquo;t participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Played Humans vs Zombies and joined the Zombie Horde on Friday evening.  Also did some Frisbee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settlers of Katan on Thursday, and Cards Against Humanity on Friday/Saturday.  (Note that it is not safe to play CAH with kids around or with people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand the premise of the game and take everything being played seriously)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I wish I could have done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year I will do the Odyssey Ropes Course.  I thought there was a weight limit on it.  But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue next year, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take one of Jim&amp;rsquo;s classes, but I needed the nutrition and beginning instruction classes more.  There is only so much one can do and overlapping classes were one of the few negatives.  But I will so do the Grip Strength and the Body Weight/Gymnastics Class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I will suck at it, I want to try the Parkour class.  And the Slack line.  And the combat training/kung fu.  Pretty much all of the classes that I missed this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even would like to do the Yoga and Meditation classes.  Again, they mostly conflicted with other classes I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate.  I will do it next year.  And kick butt and take names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d do baskbetball, but I can&amp;rsquo;t improve that much in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had Paleo meals prepared for us three times a day with a snack in between.  It was my first full time exposure to Paleo.  I had to OD on fruits to keep my sugar levels at a safe level because there was no sugar seen.  Plenty of tea, almond milk, and coconut milk was available.  I was a bit worried about food, but for the most part this concern was unfounded.  We were given a choice of various options for sleep at night - you could have a full cabin experience, a semi-private cabin room, or a hotel room.  I opted for the semi-private, but I will probably do the full cabin experience next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Sweet Home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nPvSZEj4uzbvZfeAWW0zzykoLhrb0apDhLBY4IoV010&#34; alt=&#34;Home Sweet Home&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was awesome?  Everything.  As others have said, everyone seemed like family..  Other than my self-imposed isolation at meal times, I felt like I was around lifelong friends although we all had just me just days earlier.  This is what I call a life transformational event (more on that in the second post).  I miss camp and wish I could be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go back again?  Yes.  It was already decided that there will be another event next year and I expect many of the attendees from this year to attend.  In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take part with some of the local events (again, see the second part of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you go?  If you can hang out with a group of geeks and nerds (and if you read this blog, it is probably applicable), then yes, you should go.  You&amp;rsquo;ll leave learning something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/21/camp-nerd-fitness-photo-gallery/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for links to public photo galleries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about &lt;a href=&#34;http://camp.nerdfitness.com&#34;&gt;Camp Nerd Fitness&lt;/a&gt; including future updates that will include a promo video produced at camp this year plus information about next years camp when announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A HERO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a OneNote file setup available &lt;a href=&#34;https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1395C0AC819A7E3F%212779&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that has the resources I learned from at Camp.  I&amp;rsquo;ll migrate it eventually to the final setup we workout.  If you are a camp participant, look at the Alumni Page on FB for a link that will let you edit it (or email me).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Road Ahead (CNF Part 2)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated on 3/2/2015 to bring things up-to-date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated on 10/18/2014 to Mark Off Items From the List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated on 10/26/2014 for Amy&amp;rsquo;s Bootcamp, Going Shirtless, and an update on Softball/Wiffleball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this series (&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/28/camp-nerd-fitness-post-mortum/&#34;&gt;Camp Nerd Fitness Post-Mortem&lt;/a&gt;), I described my experiences at camp.  As I said in the article, this was one of my life transformational events.  What is a life transformational event?  These are important events that change the direction of my life henceforth.  Examples of such events include starting college (gaining the first independence of my young life), starting my first full-time job, and when the last member of my immediate family passed away (transitioning to a life alone in the world).  So what was the big deal that caused camp to be life transformational?  It was the fact that I forced myself to barge right through the barriers of my life like an Angry Bull in Pampona.  Could I have done this myself?  Possibly.  But what made the experience to be the best I could have forseen was the fact that the group of people I was with unknowingly supported me in this effort.  If I did this in what I term the real world, I faced an uncertain result - maybe ridicule, maybe worse.  Did I feel out of place?  Unfortunately I still have to say Yes, but it is a qualified Yes.  I&amp;rsquo;m an introvert.  I&amp;rsquo;m an Aspie.  I&amp;rsquo;m still uncomfortable around meal times and still don&amp;rsquo;t catch sarcasm and humor all of the time.  There are many hurdles to tackle and I did the best that I can and I felt that I accomplished all of the goals that I wanted plus a whole lot more.  I still have more hurdles to face.  Will it be hard?  Heck yes, but it is doable.  I have more on these hurdles and how I hope to overcome them later on this post.  I came to camp thinking that I was going to be a definite outlier because of my size.  While I was the largest person at camp, I felt no stigma and I felt accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I left the airport following the trip, I actually spent most of the drive home crying.  Crying for missing the people and the things we were doing.  Crying for the success of breaking my barriers.  Crying in realizing that I have thusfar wasted way too many experiences and that I need to make permanent changes.  Thus I happily embrace the mantel of #CNF365 that has been passing around the CNF 2014 Alumni Facebook page.  Living out the success and leaning on others for the inevitable failures.  Seeing some people as my &amp;ldquo;Yodas&amp;rdquo; and being a Yoda to my &amp;ldquo;Padawan&amp;rdquo;.  Support others as they endeavor to be the best version of themselves possible.  But I realize I needed to make fundamental changes to various aspects of my life.  In particular, I am tired of being the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alone.  I live my life in a self-imposed isolation ward and tend to push people away who try to get close.  This is true in both my platonic friendships and in any romantic situation I find myself in.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to not be alone.  I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in a relative &amp;ldquo;Alone&amp;rdquo; state since I graduated from college.  I then was in a codependent relationship to the parent that I was acting as a caregiver for.  This became my social life at the expense of normal friendships and relationships.  Now that I face the world alone, I&amp;rsquo;m a neophyte in building relationships.  It is easy to build a cordial relationship with me, but it is another thing entirely to build a deeper relationship.  I need to fix this.  I need to overcome this natural inhibition and whatever effect my ace tendencies causes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear and Anxiety.  I live in a constant state of fear and anxiety.  This drives many of the experiences of my life.  I conquered some of this at camp, but it was only a tip of the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laziness.  I&amp;rsquo;m lazy.  I&amp;rsquo;m disorganized.  I&amp;rsquo;m a slob.  It manifests itself in many ways.  I don&amp;rsquo;t push myself to be the best that I can be.  I accept and embrace mediocracy.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be this way.  But I will generally take the easy way vs the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self Esteem.  You can probably guess my self esteem is an issue just based on the last three items.  I don&amp;rsquo;t feel a sense of worth in myself.  I&amp;rsquo;m a giver.  I&amp;rsquo;m Spock - &amp;ldquo;The Good of the Many Outweigh the Good of the One&amp;rdquo;.  I need to be able to set some time aside for myself and do things that are important for me.  This is not in my nature.  But with a self esteem in the cellar, this is something that is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a big list and there are many levels and layers involved.  But I think it is possible to overcome these issues and convert me into the best that I can be.  So what are my goals in moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect my body.  Continue on my weight loss journey.  Have the surgery I need.  Build strength.  Look good naked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build sincere and lasting relationships.  Overcome my fear of people and interact socially.  Go out of my comfort zone and find things to do.  If I can&amp;rsquo;t find someone to do something with, meet someone new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get out of the frying pan.  The constant worrying and stress is not helping me on my journey. I need to stop second guessing myself and forgive myself for things I have done in the past that contribute to the stress and worry.  Speak out and express myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get my rump out and do things.  Stop hiding.  Do things.  Do &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that scares you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems simple?  Yeah right.  So my goal is to stop making my life comfortable.  Live completely outside the comfort zone and remove the mask that I don to function in society and be my real self.  This was the realization I made during my drive home from camp.  Easier said than done?  Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what lies on my road ahead?  I have came up with a list of things that I want to do in the next year or so.  Everything is doable if I put my mind to it.  Some of it will kick my butt.  But I need my butt kicked and go all out in efforts.  So what are these things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Karaoke (to get over my fear, anxiety, and self esteem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a one-legged bodyweight squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a pull-up.  A real pull-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to PorkChopPlatoon LAN next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a 5K.  Note the term &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo;.  Not walk.  I can do better than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a Tough Mudder or Spartan Race.  I don&amp;rsquo;t care how long it takes me to finish - just the fact that I would do this.  &lt;strong&gt;Doing Warrior Dash in March 2015 - I think this would apply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Softball A good start in a team sport and will force me to work with others on a team. &lt;strong&gt;I tried.  They cancelled my Softball league.  Then they cancelled my Wiffleball league.  I may try a church softball league later in the spring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Toastmasters.  Push the comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to a Party and not hide.  Be a center of attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb Enchanted Rock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hike Mt. Rainier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel someplace I haven&amp;rsquo;t been before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;Play more table top games (i.e., go to meetups).&lt;/s&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Going to the New Braunfels Table Top Game Meetup.  Also went to Pax South 2015 and did games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try Cosplay.  Probably not something I would normally like to do, but something to push my limits.  &lt;strong&gt;Meant to do at Pax South, but this will probably wait until next year or if there is a Comicon in Austin/San Antonio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a random person every day and just talk with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually do the whole Girlfriend thing.  It has been years since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a proper boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.  But I am not getting any younger.  &lt;strong&gt;I suck at this.  There are personal reasons for this, but this is probably going to be the hardest thing for me as it will force me to change in ways that will be terribly difficult.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Ultimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat 250 pounds.  &lt;strong&gt;Getting closer.  My PR is 220.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bench Press 200 pounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw a Party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;Take my shirt off in public and not be embarrassed.&lt;/s&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Done.  And furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;m making my shirtless &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; pictures live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Dodgeball or Flag Football.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a 10K.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;Survive all of Amy&amp;rsquo;s Bootcamp.&lt;/s&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;I survived.  I actually did all of the bootcamp with only two major breaks which is freaking awesome for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camping.  &lt;s&gt;Hiking&lt;/s&gt;.  Running.  &lt;strong&gt;Hiking was done in October 2014 and a few trails in 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go To CNF 2015.  &lt;strong&gt;Signed up and Paid for 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;March Halftime at Alumni Band at the UT/Iowa State Game in two weeks. &lt;/s&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for more information.  Done&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have my surgery that has triggered the more urgent need to lose weight.  It will be painful and have a slow recovery, but I need this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are (some of the) things I would like to accomplish by this time next year.  Some have already been planned - I want to climb Enchanted Rock this weekend.  Others will be planned when I can actually do them.  But it is possible right now to do all of theses things if I put my mind in the right place and pretend barriers are not for me and be the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing things will include my standard workouts including bodyweight squats, rows, pushups and planks.  Throw in some powerlifting and challenging walks/hikes/runs.  So help me on this journey.  If you see me slacking, kick my butt.  If you see me doing less than the best, do likewise.  Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comal Community Band 2014 New Braunfels Independence Day</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/media/new-braunfels-independence-day/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the music from the Independence Day celebration in New Braunfels TX at the Bandstand in the Main Plaza.  The music selection includes a plethora of marches and patriotic songs.  As this was an outoor performance, you will hear ambient sounds from the parade while listening to the music.  The music is a bit woodwind heavy due to the placement of the recorder in an out-of-the-way space...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocals were performed by CCB member Jacob Cantu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comal Community Band Summer 2014 Pre-4th of July Concert</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/media/comal-community-band-summer-2014-pre-4th-concert/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the music from the June 29, 2014 Concert held at Wesley Hall at the First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels.  This was our pre-4th of July concert featuring patriotic music.  This concert is given as a &#34;thank-you&#34; to church for allowing us to use their facilities after New Braunfels ISD shuts down for the holidays/summer.  This concert is the last performance of this season with the full band.  A smaller group will be playing for the 4th of July Parade in Downtown New Braunfels next Friday morning starting at 8:30 AM featuring many Sousa marches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singing group for the Star Spangled Banner, The Pledge of Allegiance, the Battle Hymn of the Republic, and the Armed Forces Salute was Suono D&#39;Amore (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/suonodamore/info&#34;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt;), which was led by CCB member Jacob Cantu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Blog Assimilated</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/oldnetblog/network-blog-assimilated/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/oldnetblog/network-blog-assimilated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have made a few huge updates today to the website.  Besides the tweaking of the overall look, I have assimilated my Network Blog postings onto the new Jekyll blog and will post about both on here.  I brought most of the posts from the former site here - but I did do some &amp;ldquo;Spring Cleaning&amp;rdquo; by removing ones that were time-related (webchats and so forth) and kept the old URL if possible.  There have been a few changes, however:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URL &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkblog.net&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://www.networkblog.net&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; will redirect to this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feed URL for just the network blog is now &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog.xml&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can access just the network blog postings by browsing to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog/&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll is awesome and I can stop worrying about security issues with Wordpress (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, but I wanted to be a bit more secure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The site is hosted on Github (Github Pages) and other content is served by a variety of CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).  Thus I can post big files and use the Google CDN to serve the file in lieu of my old cable modem connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanence.  Keeping the files here provides a sense of permanence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Coming?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at work, I am currently in a middle of a big (huge for us) deployment of new laptops to all staff.  I plan to post some of the MDT and WDS tidbits I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.  (the deployment was on Windows 8.1 on the new boxen and Windows 7 on the old)  I&amp;rsquo;m also looking into an awesome networking security product that is free (PacketFence).  I&amp;rsquo;m also going to post my code for a MAPI utility that you can use to add a mailbox into someone&amp;rsquo;s Outlook Profile as a part of a logon script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>May 2014 Fitness Summary</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/may-2014-fitness-summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/may-2014-fitness-summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my summary posting of my May 2014 fitness activities.  Most of my workouts and tracking is available on the main page of this website under the Fitness Log tab.  This contains my Walk/Jogging activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of May, I tracked that I walked or jogged approximately 30 miles in monitored activities (i.e., I did a planned walking/jogging workout;  this does not include the incidental walking that I do during the day).  This 30 miles were a part of 19 separate workouts.  The most I walked in 1 day was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/576023697&#34;&gt;2.38 miles on May 19&lt;/a&gt;.  The least was the logged 0.65 miles from May 29 when I was walking around the downtown of Grapevine in the middle of the day.  It was more a sightseeing log than an actual workout.  The area around my hotel was rather dangerous so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to do any other outings when I was in Dallas at the end of May.  Note also that all of these walks/runs except for the 29th also includes my dog Rudy.  So I am a bit slowed by him at time when he stops to pee on everything and to smell every fence post/mailbox/etc on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I changed from Endomondo to MapMyRun and acquired a bluetooth 4 heart rate sensor that I use to check my exertion level.  I also acquired running shoes because walking shoes don&amp;rsquo;t seem to cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting towards the end of May, I started working out again at the gym (LA Fitness in San Antonio) working on primarily upper arm strength.  I also do a little bit of cardio depending on the availablity of machines (I did a 4 mile per hour run for 5 minutes on a treadmill or 6 floors of stairs on the Stairmaster).  Gym is still a little intimidating and I don&amp;rsquo;t like when there are a lot of people in the locker room because I am very self conscious in my appearance.  I need to learn the &amp;ldquo;DGAF&amp;rdquo; technique that peers have encouraged on Reddit or Nerd Fitness.  This week I plan to do some of the water fitness activities - just walking laps in the pool will help build up more muscle because of the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the gym front, I&amp;rsquo;m weighing the thought to join ResoluteFit when they open because some of their services could be beneficial to me.  My problem is that I think I also need the gym in San Antonio so that I can workout after work.  Once I get home, the only thing that I normally do is to walk.  It is very hard to motivate me to go to somewhere like Planet Fitness to workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the weight side, I will make a comparison to the end of March/beginning of April 2014 since I have accurate data only to that point.  The first scale I bought is very off at times and will sometimes give me weights up to 5 pound different every time I use it.  So out it went and I went back to my old scale which was consistent.  Since March, I have gone from 398 down to 378 +/- a pound or two depending on what clothes I&amp;rsquo;m wearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not had my A1C recalculated yet, so no comparison there.  I will have the test results back on June 11 when I have my next doctor appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now.  Thanks for keeping up with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comal Community Band Concert - 2014 Seguin Central Park Series</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/comal-community-band-concert/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No MP3&amp;rsquo;s are available for this concert.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t release the hold button for the first part of the concert and the second half was ruined by the sounds of the fountain.  (Well, I could post them, but there would be a very loud water noise throughout the entire concert.)  I don&amp;rsquo;t think there was anywhere else where I could have put the recorder to avoid it.  Sorry guys.  :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comal Community Band will be performing for the Seguin Central Park Concert in the Park series on Sunday, June 1, 2014 starting at 7 PM Central.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about where this concert is located, please check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.recreationparks.net/TX/guadalupe/central-park-seguin&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from the City of Seguin Parks and Recreation Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concert will be broken up into two parts - the first part is German music and the second is traditional American music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song list (which may change based on time):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;german&#34;&gt;GERMAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wurzburger Weinlese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir grussen Euch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sag &amp;ldquo;Dankeschon&amp;rdquo; mit roten Rosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kannst du Knodel kochen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Musik, die geht uns ins Blut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melton-Marsch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egerlander Musikantenfest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uns&amp;rsquo;re Blasmusik&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tulpen aus Amsterdam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wir Musikanten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;american&#34;&gt;AMERICAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Tag Support</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Tag-Support/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Tag-Support/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The theme now supports tags, tag pages, and a tag cloud.  This functionality requires you to run a utility before pushing your updates to Github Pages.  In order to use tags, you need to add the following information into your YAML front matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight yaml linenos %}
tags:
    - Tag Name (can be multiple words)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tag pages will be stored in the /tags directory and the tagcloud.html file (include wherever you want to use it) is saved in the _includes directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the tag pages and tag cloud, you will need to use the new Rakefile support (see below).  Running &lt;code&gt;rake deploy&lt;/code&gt; will automatically create the tag pages before committing the changes and pushing to github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, tags support the banner functionality as described.  If either the &lt;code&gt;banner&lt;/code&gt; id or the &lt;code&gt;bannertitle&lt;/code&gt; name match the tag name, then that banner will be incorporated on that tag page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;rakefile-support&#34;&gt;Rakefile support:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website supports the following rake commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake post[&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; - Creates a post with the title &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; and saved into the _posts directory with the current date.  It will then open up your text editor (specified in config.yml).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake draft[&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; - Similar to post, but this will make it a draft without the post date and will not publish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake publish&lt;/code&gt; - Promote a draft posting to a real posting.  It will move the file from the _drafts directory to the _posts directory and will change the post date to the current date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake page[&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; - Like posts, but this time with a page.  It is moved to the pages folder by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake build&lt;/code&gt; - This will build the tag pages and will also build the full site, but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; serve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake watch&lt;/code&gt; - Builds the site and tags, then serve it.  It will also regenerate on post/page/draft changes.  You can also run &lt;code&gt;rake watch[&amp;quot;drafts&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; which will also preview the draft postings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake preview&lt;/code&gt; - This will build the site/tags, then open up a web browser to preview the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake deploy[&amp;quot;Message&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; - This will build the tag pages, add new files to the local git repository, commit the changes with the message &amp;ldquo;Message&amp;rdquo;, then push the local git repository to your origin master (likely to be github)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake tags&lt;/code&gt; - This will just build the tag pages and tag cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do the post/page publishing, there are two prototype files in the root directory that are named &lt;code&gt;_post.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_page.txt&lt;/code&gt; (these names can be updated by changing some variables in the _config.yml file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;5-27-14&#34;&gt;5/27/14&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added an &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/archives/&#34;&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt; Page.  It still kinda sucks, but I&amp;rsquo;ll work on it..  Look under the category menu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accountabilibuddy Needed</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Accountabilibuddy-Needed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Accountabilibuddy-Needed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in need of finding an Accountability Partner for multiple things (one person could satisify both needs).  I need someone to kick my butt to help me keep down on the fitness path - someone who won&amp;rsquo;t take my excuses when I hurt too much or just don&amp;rsquo;t want to do the things that I need to do.  I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll provide the same support to my accountability partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second need is keeping more with the traditional role of the Accountability Partner.  Someone who can keep me following the straight and narrow path.  I have been plagued with thoughts that I should not be thinking.  I have said things that I definitely should not have said.  Like I&amp;rsquo;ve said before, I&amp;rsquo;m a single guy who is still incredibly weak.  The problem I have is that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough other single guys at church who can satisfy this role for me.  There are married guys, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to reciprocate as an accountability partner with some one who is married because I don&amp;rsquo;t understand or know their perspective of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are in need of an accountability partner, feel free to contact me and we can talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreyrandow.org/accountability-public/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more information on what an Accountability Partner is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life Updates and Musings</title>
      <link>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Life-Updates-And-Musings/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io/blogs/Life-Updates-And-Musings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(includes updates from May 25, 2014 - JER)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten this website to a functional level, so I guess it is time to do an update on what is going on in my life right now.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying myself working on some interesting projects at work.  Life is different in the non-engineering world and I think it would have been better if I had changed a few years earlier than I did.  I do some programming, but I am starting to get a bit rusty due to a lack of practice.  Most of the programming that I have been doing has been Python scripting, with a bit of web programming mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the spring semester off of school in order to work on all of the special projects at work that hopefully will be done by the end of summer.  I then plan on restarting school in some form or fashion either in the fall or next spring.  I have been asked in the past about why I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to school.  The answer is mainly to help me keep my sanity and to maintain at least a modicum of social life.  In the past, I would just hibernate in my house after work and never get out and do things.  This is not healthy for me.  School (at least at Texas State) requires me to interact with other people and I actually had some sort of social life while going to school.  UTSA has been a bit different in that regards, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be seeing more postings of me on Facebook or Twitter about my new fitness kick.  About two months ago I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes.  I thought that my kicking of the soft drink habit would help keep my sugar levels down, but apparently my substitute drink was worse (sweet tea, then half-and-half tea).  So I started taking Lantus at the end of March.  This has lowered my blood sugars considerably.  However, I do not plan on staying on the regimen for a long period of time.  In order for that to happen, I must lose a lot of weight.  So I&amp;rsquo;m walking/jogging several times a week and have changed my diet to a more &amp;ldquo;Paleo&amp;rdquo; form.  I post a daily log of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing on Twitter under the username &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeffreyfitness&#34;&gt;@jeffreyfitness&lt;/a&gt;.  These include the tracks from MapMyRun and a weight/blood sugar log.  I&amp;rsquo;m using this feed as my accountability log.  I&amp;rsquo;m also following the suggestions from the Nerd Fitness website for starting a bit of strength training and just fitness in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started to do my workouts (other than the walking/jogging) at either Planet Fitness in New Braunfels (for a lack of a better place to go that has hours that I can live with) and the LA Fitness on 410/Blanco in San Antonio (it is close to work, fairly cheap, and has a pool that I can start doing AquaFit).  I&amp;rsquo;m curious about the ResoluteFit option at the new hospital in New Braunfels, but they have not posted much information other than telling you to email their staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else is going on?  I&amp;rsquo;m living with my ongoing battle with my house.  I think I have figured out that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to rebuild it, but I will need to hire a remodeling person/company to fix my ceilings (remove the popcorn that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already fallen and fix all my corners by retaping) and to do something about my dysfunctional bathroom(s) and kitchen.  I think I have a wall of mold behind my shower and I do not have a working lavatory sink in my master bathroom.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything special or high end for any of these rooms.  The house is not being improved for resell value - it needs to be improved to make it more functional and usable.  I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to get rid of more things.  Anyone want some China?  I&amp;rsquo;m a guy and I don&amp;rsquo;t ever see me having any dinner parties at my house which would require China.  Besides, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been used in over 20 years.  I truly don&amp;rsquo;t even see the point of having a dining room.  I pretty much just set stuff down on the table and leave it there.  I have a small table in the kitchen that I use for meals and the such.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit very well, though.  The kitchen could be reconfigured to some point.  I just have no clue where to begin or whom to call to even talk about this.&lt;/p&gt;

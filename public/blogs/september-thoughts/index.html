           <p>I just posted what was probably my first three page long rant posting.  It&rsquo;s password protected as it was only meant for me to have a relief posting.  It helped somewhat&hellip;  :)</p>

<p>On to my regular posting.  It has been almost five months since the incident.  I&rsquo;m still struggling with raw emotions, grief, and regrets quite a few times a week.  It&rsquo;s getting better in some ways and worse in other ways.  This is normal, though.  Time will act as the best salve for what is vexing me&hellip;</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t comment on work other than to say that I am not a happy camper right now&hellip;  Four of my officemates, though, have been of incredible help and comfort to me as of late.  I will try to be a better and happier worker, but it will require a strength of will and forgiveness that will be difficult for me to muster.</p>

<p>Since my last posting, I have gone to two high school football games (New Braunfels versus Seguin and NB Canyon), one college game (UT vs FAU), and a game watching party for the UT vs UTEP game last night.  I used to go to the high school football games all the time back when my father was still alive, so going back proved to be a good distraction for me.  So good, in fact, that I ended up buying season tickets for New Braunfels home games.  The UT/FAU game was my normal opening game that I have attended every year since 1997 when I first started getting UT season tickets.  And last night, a college friend who lives in New Braunfels decided to hold a game watching party at his house.  He projected the game against a sheet hung over his (open) garage door.  The weather was perfect and the fellowship was great.  As for church, I spent the past two weeks at Oakwood Baptist in New Braunfels - last week at their Sunday night service and then I was invited to one of the morning services this morning.  I like their church - I just wish it had more traditional worship.  I prefer the Sunday evening as it is in a much smaller and cozier venue and I don&rsquo;t have to fight parking to get in and out.</p>

<p>This week I have two more games and I will be staying up in Austin to geocache after the game - that or climbing Mt Bonnell.  I have a Doctor appointment on Friday that I am a bit concerned about (the pinched nerve, or what I think is a pinched nerve, in my toe is a bit concerning) and Rudy has a vet visit Friday afternoon for his last set of puppy shots.  And this weekend, I think I will check out Crossroads Community Church in Austin - another college friend is on the staff their and listening to a few of the sermons online proves that they are orthodox which is a requirement for me.</p>

<p>That will be it for now.  Thanks for listening.</p>

<p>YBIC, Jeffrey</p>

           <p>Well, I&rsquo;m quickly approaching the two month anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s passing (one week from today on Father&rsquo;s Day).  I have had my ups and downs.  Some days are incredible.  Some days involve me dwelling in places so horrible that I can&rsquo;t believe my mind can conjure them.  I know this is a process and that everyone has to go through it.  When my dad passed away a bit over ten years ago, the grief process wasn&rsquo;t as involved.  It was there, but was abbreviated since I wasn&rsquo;t that close with him over the years.  Living the past six years as a caregiver, especially the past four years has made me have an attachment to my mother that basically borders on co-dependence.  The normalcy of my life has disappeared.  Cope, I have.  I still have outbursts of pain, sadness, and dejection that border on depression, though. </p>

<p>This past weekend was one of the times when I searched the depths of my soul. Today, I spent about three hours crying and yelling and about seven hours total this weekend.  To quote Thomas Paine, these are the times that try men&rsquo;s souls.  Although I am not undergoing the struggles that Thomas Paine meant in The Crisis, I am fighting my own internal war.  I see a light at the end of the tunnel, but the journey there is fraught with difficulty and pain.  I realize that this is therapeutic and I will end up being a better man for going through it, the process still is extremely painful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m striving to be strong through this experience.  I have some incredible friends who have done much to help me deal with all of these crises I am undergoing.  I can&rsquo;t thank them enough for being there, for putting up with my stubborness and naivete, and for forcing me to push the envelope so to speak.  I may struggle and resist, but the experience is worth it. </p>

<p>So, as I complete the second month anniversary this week, I must reflect on my experiences thusfar:</p>

<p>My promises and their Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try new things&hellip;  This one is probably my hardest, but it is one that I am actively forcing myself to do, sometimes with a bit of prodding by others.  I give myself a solid C+ here.</li>
<li>Attend church weekly&hellip;  This one I have done&hellip;  I&rsquo;m looking for a church to call home and have been &ldquo;church shopping&rdquo; the past two months..  I think that I may have a permanent solution, but it has to be right for me and my theological viewpoint.</li>
<li>Exercise more&hellip;  I started well, but have back slid a bit lately.  I have been averaging about 2.5 miles every time I go out on a walk, but lately it has only been 3~4 times a week.  This is partially due to heat and also partially due to other problems.</li>
<li>Take care of my health&hellip;  Like above, I&rsquo;m trying to do this&hellip;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t dwell&hellip;  I dwell.  I always have.  I think I always will.  This requires a major change in my psychological makeup.  I&rsquo;m better than I used to be, but most would say that I am a pathological &ldquo;dwell&rdquo;-er.  This is a solid D+ here.</li>
<li>Reconnect with friends&hellip;  I&rsquo;m trying here&hellip;  This is a bit hard because I burned quite a few bridges..  A lot of my problems relate to my naivete and I don&rsquo;t realize that I may have offended or off-put someone and I don&rsquo;t fix it immediately.  I&rsquo;m working on this.</li>
<li>Meet people&hellip;  I still chicken out way too easily here.  I need a &ldquo;social security blanket&rdquo; before I feel safe to go out and try.  So my likelihood of meeting someone and get into a real relationship is a bit dreary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li>My brain is the source of a lot of my problems..  I overreact and over-compensate way too much.</li>
<li>I have a lot of work to do.  It will take forever to get everything under control.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m too stressed out to be very effective.  I&rsquo;m adjusting to stress and am trying not to force myself to do more than I can handle, but then I upset others.</li>
<li>My temper is much shorter.  I seem to have no problem telling others who have pushed me too far.  This is new.</li>
<li>I miss both of my parents very dearly and know that I will see them again in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for listening and reading as I rambled on here&hellip;</p>

           <p>This is the first of two posts that I hope will chronicle my experiences at the most awesome event that I attended between September 18-21, 2014 at a camp nestled in the mountains of northern Georgia.  This inaugural event was held by Steve Kamb and the crew at the website <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com">NerdFitness</a> plus some awesome teachers who educated and motivated us to be the best person physically and mentally that we can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/28/the-road-ahead-(cnf-part-2)/">Part 2 - The Road Ahead is here.</a></p>

<p>What is Nerd Fitness?  I think it is fairly summarized well by the <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2014/09/15/the-oath-of-the-nerd-fitness-rebellion/">Nerd Fitness Oath</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a Nerd Fitness Rebel, and today is the first day of the rest of my life.  I shall make no excuses and hold no grudges.</p>

<p>I care not where I came from, only where I am going.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t compare myself to others, only to myself from yesterday.</p>

<p>I shall not brag about successes nor complain about my struggles, but share my experiences and help my fellow Rebels. I know I impact those around me with my actions, and so I must move forward, every day.</p>

<p>I acknowledge fear, doubt, and despair, but I do not let them defeat me. I pledge my life and honor for the Rebellion, for this day and all the days to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides all of the awesome articles written by Steve, there is an active community of &ldquo;Rebels&rdquo; at <a href="http://rebellion.nerdfitness.com">The Rebellion</a>.  (In the forums, I am <a href="http://rebellion.nerdfitness.com/index.php?/user/29381-wxstormer/">wxstormer</a>).  For a small fee, there is also another group known as the Nerd Fitness Academy for more intensive discussions and help along the journey.</p>

<p>So how did I like the weekend?  Like most of the other participants, I think it was the best weekend of my life.  I wonder why I struggled with the decision to actually attend.  I wavered for a few months - should I go or should I stay?  It took my last hospital stay to throw me into the &ldquo;should I go&rdquo; side.  For those who don&rsquo;t know, I need to lose a fairly substantial amount of weight to have a surgery that should hopefully fix the issue that has been causing me to spend so much time in the hospital for the past three years.  Plus I hate the way that I look.  Those were the motivating factors that caused me to commit to going on the trip and to join the Academy.</p>

<p>On my fitness journey, I have a goal to lose just about 150 pounds since my starting weight just under 400 pounds at the end of March 2014.  I have lost almost 50 pounds in the subsequent months and still have about 100 more to lose.  So my first fear to conquer was flying.  I have not flown anywhere for about 6 years, so I was concerned about what my experience would be flying on the plane.  So I&rsquo;m happy to note that I was able to fly to and from Atlanta on Delta using the provided seat belt (no extender necessary).  That was awesome.  But then the hard part started.  I&rsquo;m an Aspie and I have trouble being in social situations.  So once I landed in Atlanta, I found the group waiting to board the shuttle and kept circling it and thinking &ldquo;should I&rdquo; or &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo;.  This is a classic problem for me.  Generally I answer &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; and go hide in a corner and try to blend into the background.  However this trip was designed by me to force me past by barriers and to push me way beyond my comfort zone.  I found that the article &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/web/20130517030436/http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/01/20/why-you-need-to-do-sh-that-scares-you/">Do <em>stuff</em> That Scares You</a>&rdquo; is the tactic that I used for the weekend (&ldquo;Stuff&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the word that is in the article, but this is a family friendly blog) as well as some Social Skills and Confidence articles from the Academy.  So I picked and chose my place and entered the group.  It was hard but worth the effort.  I found that everyone was welcoming and friendly.  Crisis-averted.</p>

<p>The First Shuttle Crowd:</p>

<p>The camp was held at Camp Ramah Darom located to the northwest of Clayton, GA nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wDyNm6u5z7KcHsQLe2tpxtAblKq3ViezwXpYdfkcpq4" alt="Camp Headquarters" /></p>

<p>What did I do?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nutrition Lessons - Anthony Mychal taught a beginner Nutrition Class and June (Nerd Fitness Staff) taught a Paleo Meal Planning and a Basic Cooking Class.  Staci (Nerd Fitness) did a class on how complicated our relationships can be with food and how to overcome our difficulties with food.</p></li>

<li><p>Pyschological Classes - Amy Clover presented a &ldquo;Depression and Exercise&rdquo; class in how to best overcome negative thoughts.  She also presented a &ldquo;Body Image and Self Esteem&rdquo; class that has continued to the present day to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeffreycentex/posts/10152500539772912">post</a> on my Facebook page.</p></li>

<li><p>A Beginner Bodyweight class taught by Steve Kamp (and helped by Taylor Share) teaching the proper way to do BodyWeight Squats, PushUps, and Arm Rows (and a little bit of special training on Planks).</p></li>

<li><p>The Big 4 Lifts taught by Staci that taught us the basics of weight lifting including proper form for bench press, bar squats, and the deadlift.</p></li>

<li><p>Mobility classes taught by Kate and Anthony.  Kate&rsquo;s class was more catered to Yoga and Anthony&rsquo;s was a reinforcement to Steve&rsquo;s BodyWeight class.</p></li>

<li><p>Attempted the bootcamp on Saturday morning.  Although I can only handle a few minutes of Amy&rsquo;s HIIT bootcamp, it was awesome and makes me want to strive to be able to fully do it next year.  I will be doing her bootcamp in <a href="http://www.stronginsideouttour.com/austin/">Austin</a> later this month, but I will probably only be a little more successful in it.</p></li>

<li><p>Lots of talking with my fellow campers over lunch.</p></li>

<li><p>Attended the costume party as a character from the Game of Thrones (as best as I could be).</p></li>

<li><p>Observed the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube costume party, but didn&rsquo;t participate.</p></li>

<li><p>Played Humans vs Zombies and joined the Zombie Horde on Friday evening.  Also did some Frisbee.</p></li>

<li><p>Settlers of Katan on Thursday, and Cards Against Humanity on Friday/Saturday.  (Note that it is not safe to play CAH with kids around or with people who don&rsquo;t understand the premise of the game and take everything being played seriously)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What do I wish I could have done?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Next year I will do the Odyssey Ropes Course.  I thought there was a weight limit on it.  But that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue next year, I hope.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to take one of Jim&rsquo;s classes, but I needed the nutrition and beginning instruction classes more.  There is only so much one can do and overlapping classes were one of the few negatives.  But I will so do the Grip Strength and the Body Weight/Gymnastics Class.</p></li>

<li><p>Though I will suck at it, I want to try the Parkour class.  And the Slack line.  And the combat training/kung fu.  Pretty much all of the classes that I missed this year.</p></li>

<li><p>I even would like to do the Yoga and Meditation classes.  Again, they mostly conflicted with other classes I want to do.</p></li>

<li><p>Ultimate.  I will do it next year.  And kick butt and take names.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;d do baskbetball, but I can&rsquo;t improve that much in the next year.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We had Paleo meals prepared for us three times a day with a snack in between.  It was my first full time exposure to Paleo.  I had to OD on fruits to keep my sugar levels at a safe level because there was no sugar seen.  Plenty of tea, almond milk, and coconut milk was available.  I was a bit worried about food, but for the most part this concern was unfounded.  We were given a choice of various options for sleep at night - you could have a full cabin experience, a semi-private cabin room, or a hotel room.  I opted for the semi-private, but I will probably do the full cabin experience next year.</p>

<p>Home Sweet Home</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nPvSZEj4uzbvZfeAWW0zzykoLhrb0apDhLBY4IoV010" alt="Home Sweet Home" /></p>

<p>So what was awesome?  Everything.  As others have said, everyone seemed like family..  Other than my self-imposed isolation at meal times, I felt like I was around lifelong friends although we all had just me just days earlier.  This is what I call a life transformational event (more on that in the second post).  I miss camp and wish I could be back.</p>

<p>Will I go back again?  Yes.  It was already decided that there will be another event next year and I expect many of the attendees from this year to attend.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to take part with some of the local events (again, see the second part of this post).</p>

<p>Should you go?  If you can hang out with a group of geeks and nerds (and if you read this blog, it is probably applicable), then yes, you should go.  You&rsquo;ll leave learning something.</p>

<p><strong>I AM A HERO</strong></p>

<p>I have a OneNote file setup available <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1395C0AC819A7E3F%212779">here</a> that has the resources I learned from at Camp.  I&rsquo;ll migrate it eventually to the final setup we workout.  If you are a camp participant, look at the Alumni Page on FB for a link that will let you edit it (or email me).</p>

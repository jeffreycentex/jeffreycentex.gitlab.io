## How do you contact me?

The best way to contact me is via email.  I have several and most of them will reach me direcly.  My primary email address is **jrandow at ctetg dot com**.

I am also usually available via Hangout using the Google Plus link above.  For that matter, you can usually reach me at any of the social networks listed above.

In real life, I'm rather hard to contact because I tend to stay away from the limelight and hide in the face of attention.  :)

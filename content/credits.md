## Website Information and Credits

This website is powered by Jekyll - which is a static page generator that runs under Ruby - and is hosted by Github Pages (this website is in one of my public repositories).  The theme is a forked version of [Jordan Thornquest's](http://www.jordanthornquest.com) Bootstrap Jekyll theme that has been modularized and templated.  I also use MediaElements.js to help serve the music and video media on this site.

The Rakefile was adopted and adapted from multiple sources.  The build functionality was from [Ellen Gummesson's](https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-rake-boilerplate) project and the Tags were adopted from many sources including [Justkez](http://www.justkez.com/generating-a-tag-cloud-in-jekyll/).

All external media is stored on Google Drive which is functioning as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) in order to increase bandwidth and usability.

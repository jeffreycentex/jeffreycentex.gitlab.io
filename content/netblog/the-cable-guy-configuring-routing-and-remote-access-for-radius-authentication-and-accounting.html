<p>I missed the posting for the new Cable Guy article at Technet: </p>
<p>Configuring Routing and Remote Access for RADIUS Authentication and Accounting</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/default.mspx"> http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/default.mspx</a> </p>
<p>I actually met the technical writer for the Networking Team who writes the Cable Guy articles (as well as authoring some excellent networking books for <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Press) today at the product group drill down day (MVP Summit).  Pretty interesting guy&#8230;</p>

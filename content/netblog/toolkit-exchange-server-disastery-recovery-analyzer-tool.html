<p>OK - another Exchange tool to keep in the back of your mind in case you should ever need it (although you can do everything this tool does manually at the command line, but that is too much pain for me).</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c86fa454-416c-4751-bd0e-5d945b8c107b&#38;displaylang=en">download site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Exchange Server Disaster Recovery Analyzer programmatically collects configuration data and header information from databases and transaction log files. The tool analyzes all headers and creates a detailed list of instructions explaining what the problem is, and how to resolve it.</p>

<p>Released on May 8.</p>

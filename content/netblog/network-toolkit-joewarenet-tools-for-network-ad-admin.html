<p>I also wanted to pass along a <a href="http://www.joeware.net/win32/index.html">link</a> to <a href="http://www.joeware.net/">Joe Richard&#8217;s </a>excellent tool library for computer and networking management, especially in an Active Directory environment&#8230; </p>
<p>Some tools I especially like are: </p>
<ol>
<li> <b>OLDCMP</b> - Oldcmp is a tool I wrote to help find old computers. It will also disable them for you and it will also delete them for you. </li>
<li> <b>NetSess</b> - The question involved how to delegate the ability to do net sessions. </li>
</ol>
<p> There are also a few tools there that will help you identify SIDs and to locate all NetBIOS servers on your network&#8230; </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.joeware.net/win32/index.html">Take a look&#8230;</a></p>

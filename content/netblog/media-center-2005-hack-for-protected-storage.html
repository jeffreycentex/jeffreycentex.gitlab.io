<p>This is a bit off-topic for here, but I have been tackling this problem for a while now and wanted to let people know how to solve this problem if they encounter it.</p>
<p>When Media Center 2005 came out, certain features were crippled in order to support MC extender devices.  Among these were the networking options.  By default, a new MC machine cannot join a domain except during setup.  This caused much consternation in the community and resulted in a lot of thinking that this meant MC was based on the Home Edition, not the Pro version.  This isn&#8217;t the case (entirely)&#8230;  MC was built on the Professional version, but the networking components were relegated to more of a Home edition status.  One casualty was that it was no longer possible to save usernames and passwords for network resources (which is what happens on XP Home based machines).</p>
<p>However, the &#8220;hack&#8221; that will let you join a MCE 2005 domain will also let you re-enable the saving of passwords.  This shouldn&#8217;t affect extenders as long as you don&#8217;t actually join a domain, but I haven&#8217;t tested that feature yet.</p>

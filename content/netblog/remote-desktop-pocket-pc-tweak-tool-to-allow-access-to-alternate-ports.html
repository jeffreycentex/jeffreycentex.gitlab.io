<p>Per the guys at Pocket PC Addict, it appears the Tweaks2K2.NET tool will allow a pocket pc user to specify an alternate port using the built-in Terminal Services client.  This has been a frequent request of the Pocket PC community and it is one I hope <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> will include with the next rev of the Windows Mobile Software.</p>

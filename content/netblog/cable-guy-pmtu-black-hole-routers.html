<p>On the topic of Cable Guys articles - there&#8217;s a new one for July&#8230;  From Joes Blog: </p>
<blockquote><p>The July 2004 TechNet Cable Guy article is titled &#8220;Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) Black Hole Routers&#8221; and describes TCP connection problems caused by PMTU black hole routers (that silently discard packets that must be fragmented for which the Don&#8217;t Fragment flag is set) and some workarounds. This is a common support problem in enterprise and Internet networking</p>

<p>I just recieved notification about the new <acronym title="IP Security">IPSEC</acronym> newsgroup available at MSNews (news://microsoft.public.windows.networking.ipsec).  If it isn&#8217;t available on your newserver, use msnews.microsoft.com or you can use the Community Pages&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
Welcome to the newsgroup dedicated to Internet Protocol Security or IPsec!  IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring private, secure communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.  Through the use of cryptographic security services,  IPsec provides the ability to protect communication between workgroups, local area network computers, domain clients and servers, branch offices (which might be physically remote), extranets, and roving clients.</p>
<p>The Microsoft implementation of IPsec is based on standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) IPsec working group. IPsec is the long-term direction for secure networking and is supported by the Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 operating systems.  </p>

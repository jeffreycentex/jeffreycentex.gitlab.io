<p>I've been waiting a bit too long to update here and missed a few things...</p>
<p>First, Joseph Davies (aka "The Cable Guy" on Technet) has released the entire TCP/IP Fundamentals forÂ  Microsoft Windows in PDF format.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c76296fd-61c9-4079-a0bb-582bca4a846f&amp;displaylang=en">here</a> for the ebook</p>
<p>More to come later today or early tomorrow...</p>

<p>I also wanted to pass along an update I got from PSS concerning WPA/PSK support on Windows 2003 Servers.. Regardless of what you may read in the Knowledge Base, there are no updates or hotfixes as of yet that will enable WPA/PSK on Windows 2003 Servers short of installing an upcoming service pack&#8230;  This question has popped up a few times in the networking newsgroups, so there was some question about this.</p>

<p>The guys over at The Invisible Things Lab have posted a possible attack vector on Truecrypt volumes using a modified bootloader that could possibly capture the volume password.  If you have a computer that can boot (or be set to boot) from USB or if it has a possible accessible hard drive (my computer has neither), then it is possible for a hacker who has physical access to a box to possibly compromise it.</p>
<p>Take it as you may...</p>

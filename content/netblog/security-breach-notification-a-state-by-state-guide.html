<p>From a mailing list that I am on:</p>
<blockquote><p>This chart provides information regarding <a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/statebreachchart/www.perkinscoie.com/statebreachchart/chart.pdf" target="_blank">security breach notification</a> legislation which has been enacted in U.S. jurisdictions. The pioneering statute on this issue, California's Security Breach Notification Act (Senate Bill No. 1386), is used as the baseline for comparisons herein.</p>

<p>It's been out for a while now (March 2007), but somehow I missed it in my security browsing.</p>

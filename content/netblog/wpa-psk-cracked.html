<p>Alas, that temporary security solution for SOHO and home wireless networks — WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Keys) — has been cracked…  Well, we knew it was inevitable.  Unfortunately, for the vast majority of small networks — like those in homes and VSBs (very small businesses) — there is no better solution for the time being…  Like the article states, 802.1x solutions are not vulnerable to this cracking.  However, implementing the required Radius or IAS solution is beyond what home and VSBs can implement.</p>
<p>Any suggestions out there?</p>

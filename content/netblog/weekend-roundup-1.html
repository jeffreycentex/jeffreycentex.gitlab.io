<p>This is the first of (hopefully) a continual series of what is new in the Networking and IT World for the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=347154">MS Internal use of Network Access Protection Channel 9 Video</a> - Jeff Sigman (of the NAP team) and Brent Atkison (of MS-IT) talk about how NAP is implemented on the Microsoft network.</li>
<li><a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/">Ubuntu 7.10 (GutsyGibbon) </a>has been released, both in Desktop and Server releases.  For the benefit of others at the office, we have implemented some of our public web servers on Ubuntu (although I am more a Centos or BSD dude...).  Downloads are still rather slow due to the Slashdot effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly Wishlist:</p>
<ul>
<li> x64 version of PageDefrag for my servers.</li>
<li>A working version of Veridian on two of my AM2 systems that should support Virtualization, but are disabled due to processor stepping level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task List for the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing the RTM build of Windows Home Server at home...</li>
<li>Upgrade my Trixbox installation and implement OpenWingo softphones...</li>
</ul>

<p>First of several quick updates:</p>
<p>The Beta 3 release of Longhorn Server has been released and is available for download on Connect...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is still nothing on the (immediate) horizon in regards to hypervisor, but one can hope..  :(</p>
<p>Also, the IIS 7 team is making a Go Live license available.  More at the <a href="http://www.iis.net/articles/view.aspx/Explore-IIS7/Whats-New-in-Longhorn-Server-Beta-3?tabid=1">IIS blog</a>...</p>

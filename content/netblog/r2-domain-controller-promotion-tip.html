<p>(from the newsgroups)</p>
<p>One of the more common issues that people are experiencing when trying to add a new Windows 2003 R2 Server on an existing Windows 2003/2000 based network is that the Active Directory schema needs to be updated.  This step is normally performed by running the <strong>adprep /forestprep</strong> command (a similar command is required for upgrading from Windows 2000 to Windows 2003).</p>
<p>However, in order to update the schema, you should run this command from the computer you deemed your &#8220;Schema Operations Master&#8221;.  However, the version of adprep that will be installed on your &#8220;Schema Operations Master&#8221; computer won&#8217;t support the schema upgrade from R2.  <strong><em>You need to use the adprep command located on the 2nd disk (the R2 setup) - not the first disk.</em></strong>  You will find the adprep command in the <strong>CMPNENTS\R2\ADPREP</strong> folder.</p>
<p>After you complete this step, you can then promote a new R2 server as a domain controller.</p>

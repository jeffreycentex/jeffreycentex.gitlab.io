<p>On Saturday, February 5, 2011, the Hill Country Community Band played in Dripping Springs for the "A Grand Evening on Broadway" at DS High School.  This was a fundraising concert with multiple groups from Dripping Springs, the Hill Country Community Band, and the Starlight Orchestra.  DS High School is attempting to fund the purchase of a Grand Piano.</p>
<p>Our performance was one song - Symphonic Dances from Fiddler on the Roof.  This was taken mid-stage with the good recorder (note the difference in recording quality).</p>
<p>Again, if you are a band member, you can email me for the link (if it isn't sent out in an email).</p>

<p>OK, this is very late, but I've had a bad month...  :(  More on that later.</p>
<p>This is from the Comal Community Band concert held on February 25 at First Protestant Church for the New Braunfels Music Study Club.  This is from the second half of the concert as the first half did not record (i.e., we are missing Wicked and the Sound of Music).  I also did not post the songs from the Hill Country Chorus as I'm not a member of their group and I don't know if they want their music posted.  </p>

<p>Here is another set of recordings from our concert yesterday.  Please note that these songs are for personal use only and are mainly intended for friends who could not attend the performance.  I will remove the links upon request.</p>
<p>Song Notes:  These songs are from my perspective in the band.  So note that they are low-brass and percussion heavy.  This would be what the concert would sound like if you were a performer.  Also note that the IPhone has a good dynamic range, but some of these songs exceed this range from time to time.  Also, the first two songs were recorded with the microphone in the wrong direction (sorry).  Also note that these songs were performed after a maximum of 4 rehersals since restarting for the fall. </p>

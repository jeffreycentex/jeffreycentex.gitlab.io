<p>This is the music from the Independence Day celebration in New Braunfels TX at the Bandstand in the Main Plaza.  The music selection includes a plethora of marches and patriotic songs.  As this was an outoor performance, you will hear ambient sounds from the parade while listening to the music.  The music is a bit woodwind heavy due to the placement of the recorder in an out-of-the-way space...</p>
<p>The vocals were performed by CCB member Jacob Cantu.</p>

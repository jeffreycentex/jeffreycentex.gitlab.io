<p>This is the first of several postings for today...</p>
<p>I tried recording our Summer Concert held today (June 28, 2009) at First United Methodist Church using my IPhone 3G.  The results actually turned out pretty good - way better than my original Fuze.  Please note that the perspective of these audio tracks is the same as one would get if you were actually sitting in the band.  So the songs are pretty brass heavy, but everything can be heard.  This also is a test of the Audio Player Plugin for Wordpress:</p>
<p>Please note that some songs have a delay before starting.  Remember that  I need to handle my instrument before starting the recordings...  :)</p>

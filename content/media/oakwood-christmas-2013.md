I played in the orchestra on this one (Tuba)..  The recording is from the 10:45 AM service.  I'm sorry about some of the ambient noises (talking, coughing, etc), but this recording is taken from the room and not the internet stream which may be missing a few instruments.  For those with kids, the Kid's choir sang the last three songs.

Please note that Jeff Owen has posted the official video of the concert on the church website (and linked below).  This one picks up the choir a lot better, but pretty much leaves out the orchestra (there is a technical reason for this, but that is why I put the recorder out to pick up everything)

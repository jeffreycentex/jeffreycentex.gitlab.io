On Tuesday, November 15, the Hill Country Community Band played a joint concert with the Wallace MS Wind Ensemble at the Hays CISD Performing Arts Center.  I have uploaded the following songs that include either HCCB songs or combined songs.  I've posted a few Youtube videos of the Wallace kids and will link to them soon.

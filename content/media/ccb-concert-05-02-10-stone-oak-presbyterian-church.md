<I have been neglecting posting concert MP3's lately.  This first batch is from a Comal Community Band Concert at Stone Oak Presbyterian Church on May 2, 2010.  This is perhaps the best set of recordings that I have due to the acoustics of the performance venue.  The second song (Texas Star) has a bit of a problem in the middle due to my recorder being knocked off of my stand.

As always, remember these songs are recorded from my perspective.  Thus the sounds of certain sections will seem to be louder than what you would here in the audience (ahem, trumpets...).

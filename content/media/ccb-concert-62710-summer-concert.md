The Comal Community Band performed it's "Thank You" concert for First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels for the use of Wesley Hall as it's summer practice facility.


Like my last set of recordings from the Hill Country Community Band, this is recorded from the crowd perspective. Â I'm sorry for the lack of volume on the first few songs as the venue was a bit loud at times.

<p>The Comal Community Band performed it's "Thank You" concert for First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels for the use of Wesley Hall as it's summer practice facility.</p>
<p>Like my last set of recordings from the Hill Country Community Band, this is recorded from the crowd perspective. Â I'm sorry for the lack of volume on the first few songs as the venue was a bit loud at times.</p>
<p>The ZIP file with all of the songs can be downloaded <a href="http://www.jeffreyrandow.org/mp3audio/ccbsummer2k10.zip">here</a>.</p>

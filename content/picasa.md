I host my photo galleries on Google Photos (formerly "Picasa"), but direct access is no longer possible (thank you Google).  So this page will contain my collection of photos.  I also have a Flickr gallery, but they have not been updated in years.  All pictures are licensed under the Creative Commons "Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International" license.

Most of these pictures are from places I have visited or of local nature/scenery.  I like doing nature photography and generally shun taking pictures of people unless I need to.

<p>I have been neglecting posting concert MP3's lately.  This first batch is from a Comal Community Band Concert at Stone Oak Presbyterian Church on May 2, 2010.  This is perhaps the best set of recordings that I have due to the acoustics of the performance venue.  The second song (Texas Star) has a bit of a problem in the middle due to my recorder being knocked off of my stand.</p>
<p>As always, remember these songs are recorded from my perspective.  Thus the sounds of certain sections will seem to be louder than what you would here in the audience (ahem, trumpets...).</p>

This is a "different" type of music posting.  On December 7, 2014, the Comal Community Band performed it's annual Christmas Concert at Stage Theatre in Bulverde, TX..  However, since this is an open house event, it gets pretty loud.  So my normal recordings do not actually work for this event.  However, I was testing out the camera in my phone while on stage and took some videos of 5 songs from the Christmas half of the presentation (there are two parts - the first is normal non-Christmas music, then an intermission, then a Christmas music finale).

So here is the result:

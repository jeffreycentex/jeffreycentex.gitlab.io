I played in the orchestra on this one (Tuba)..  The recording is from the 10:45 AM service.  I'm sorry about some of the ambient noises (talking, coughing, etc), but this recording is taken from the room and not the internet stream which may be missing a few instruments.  For those with kids, the Kid's choir sang the last three songs.

The full recording archive is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.jeffreyrandow.org/mp3audio/2013ChristmasConcert.zip">here</a>.  This is provided as is and is made available via Fair Use.

<strong>Please note that Jeff Owen has posted the official video of the concert on the church website (and linked below).  This one picks up the choir a lot better, but pretty much leaves out the orchestra (there is a technical reason for this, but that is why I put the recorder out to pick up everything) </strong>

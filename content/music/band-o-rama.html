<p>This page presents musical excerpts from the 1995 Band-O-Rama held at the Frank Erwin Center.  I was a member of the Texas Concert Band under the direction of Glenn Richter.  This was my last year in band.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to get some video added.  However, this was a home video shot by my Dad who seemed to be very interested in the curtains at the Erwin Center.  More content will be added as I can digitize it.  I will also be updating the MP3 files to a better quality when I can.</p>

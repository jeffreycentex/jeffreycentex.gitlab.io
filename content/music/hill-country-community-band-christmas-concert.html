<p>On December 17, 2010, the Hill Country Community Band performed it's Christmas concert at First Baptist Church in Wimberley.  The following files represent the music performed.  I used my older recorder that doesn't capture the full audio fidelity, but I need to find my original recorder before the next round of concerts in February for both the Comal Community Band as well as the Hill Country Community Band.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the band and would like the full MP3 packages, please contact me and I'll give you a link.</p>

<p>This is the music from the June 29, 2014 Concert held at Wesley Hall at the First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels.  This was our pre-4th of July concert featuring patriotic music.  This concert is given as a "thank-you" to church for allowing us to use their facilities after New Braunfels ISD shuts down for the holidays/summer.  This concert is the last performance of this season with the full band.  A smaller group will be playing for the 4th of July Parade in Downtown New Braunfels next Friday morning starting at 8:30 AM featuring many Sousa marches.</p>
<p>The singing group for the Star Spangled Banner, The Pledge of Allegiance, the Battle Hymn of the Republic, and the Armed Forces Salute was Suono D'Amore (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/suonodamore/info">FB</a>), which was led by CCB member Jacob Cantu.</p>

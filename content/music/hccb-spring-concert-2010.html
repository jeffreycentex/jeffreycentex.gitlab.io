<p>The following files were recorded at the Hill Country Community Band Spring 2010 Concert held on May 14, 2010 at First Baptist Church in Wimberly, TX.</p>
<p>These recordings are different than my normal ones - I placed the recorder to the rear of the sanctuary and left it running throughout the concert.  Therefore, these recordings sound like they would if you were in the audience.  The turn out was great and the concert went well.</p>
<p>This completes the long concert circuit of the months of April and May.  The  next performance will be by the Comal Community Band at the end of July and then both groups are busy on the 4th of July weekend.</p>

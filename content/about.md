## Who is Jeffrey Randow?

I'm a young-at-heart nerd and geek who loves technical topics.  In my past life (i.e., before 2011), I was a Environmental (Civil) Engineer and IT Manager for a small-to-mid-sized engineering firm in San Antonio.  In 2011, I decided to re-enter college and was awarded a Certificate for Computer Science from Texas State University-San Marcos and am currently a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  My first baccalaureate degree was from the University of Texas at Austin.

In 2012, I was diagnosed as having High Functioning Autism (formerly known as Asperger's Syndrome).  This explains my sense of extreme introversion and shyness (see [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4jktXxEAxM4/TtGkI5x8jTI/AAAAAAAAAK4/_pD0mWiIDeg/s400/cartoon.jpg) for my perspective in parties and social events).  If you get me in my zone (i.e., talking about my interests), I can talk you head off.

I am also an unabashed Christian (see my [testimony](/about/testimony/) for more information).  I volunteer at my local church as a member of the Creative Arts Team in the sound and tech ministries (I'm the sound mixer for morning overflow and Sunday Night services) and sometimes play in the Praise Band for special occasions.

I currenty am employed in an IT and Information Security role at a San Antonio nephrology practice while also attending graduate school on a part-time basis.

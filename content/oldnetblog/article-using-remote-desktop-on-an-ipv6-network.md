For the IPV6 users out there (for now, mostly academic/research institutions and those in Asian locations where the IPV4 space is dwindling rapidly), here is an article that describes how to use Remote Desktop on an IPV6 network. By default, Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server are ready to use IPV6 (although the interface is command line).  Longhorn (at least the WinHEC build) automatically will assign you an IPV6 address (based on your IPV4 address). 


Take a <a href="http://www.ipv6style.jp/en/tryout/20030523/index.shtml">look</a> at the <a href="http://www.ipv6style.jp/en/tryout/20030523/index.shtml">article</a>&#8230;  I am hoping to update it on the RNT website later with english captioned pictures.

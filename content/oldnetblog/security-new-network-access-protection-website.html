<p>OK - I am back from the abyss of work&#8230; <img src="assets/icon_smile.gif" alt=")" />  </p>
<p>There is a new website in the Windows Server community at <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> describing a technology that will be included in Windows Server 2003 Release 2 Network Access Protection. This is essentially a much more enhanced version of the <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> quarantine that debuted in Windows 2003 Server, but this one will also work in protecting your LAN from viruses and other sort of malware. I saw a demonstration of this earlier this year when I was in Redmond and all I could say is that I want it now&#8230; <img src="assets/icon_smile.gif" alt=")" />  </p>
<p>Keep an eye on the information here and make sure you submit wish requests (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mswish">http://www.microsoft.com/mswish</a>) if you would like to make suggestions for future improvements. </p>
<p>My wish is for it to be much simpler to implement than the <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> quarantine in Windows 2003.   Especially when you need to quarantine non-domain member computers connecting over a <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>.</p>

I want to make a plea to either the Exchange or the Windows Mobile team at Microsoft (I&#8217;m not sure which one to talk to about this) - <b>support synchronization of public folders to <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Mobile Devices</b>.


By supporting synchronization, I mean the following:


<ul>
<li>Allow a Public Folder of Contact Information to be synced to a Smartphone/Pocket PC without the hacking/kludging that the Outlook PCS tool requires</li>
<li>Allow the syncronization of a public folder that includes a team calendar</li>
<li>(Not public folder related, but&#8230;)Allow the synchronization of Contact subfolders</li>
</ul>
Actually, I would like to encourage the Outlook team to think about the same thing.  Why is it that we can&#8217;t include a calendar public folder with our own calendar folders.  We can if we are using a Sharepoint site.  Why make public folders a second class citizen.  


I face these issues daily since all of our Project Managers and Officers have Smartphones that are Activesync&#8217;ed to the Exchange Server.  However, our team contact databases are in public folders.  Thus, I must go to everyone and install/setup Outlook PCS to bring in the public folder contacts contents so the phone can sync.  However, this syncronization isn&#8217;t (or it doesn&#8217;t work) bi-directional.  You can&#8217;t change one of these contacts on the phone and then have the Public Folder updated, like you can with your &#8220;local&#8221; contacts.


If anyone from the Outlook/Windows Mobile/or Exchange team wants to discuss this, contact me&#8230;


Anyone else have this wish?

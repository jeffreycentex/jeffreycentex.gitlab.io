I know this is old news now, but I am still a bit upset that the <acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> (Network Access Protection) (Network Access Protection) services have been removed from the next version of Windows 2003 Server (the so-called R2 release).  This was the main killer feature for me, at least, in the upcoming release.  If you run in a small- to mid-sized shop, it is expensive (in both cost and time) to implement a good physical security policy concerning network access.  <acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> would have solved the problems with rogue computers (or even rouge APs) on the network at a relative minimum of cost.


In the interim, I would recommend that <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> beef up the <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> quarantine facility in time for the R2 release…  This would help immensely.

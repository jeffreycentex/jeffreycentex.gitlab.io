I have made a few huge updates today to the website.  Besides the tweaking of the overall look, I have assimilated my Network Blog postings onto the new Jekyll blog and will post about both on here.  I brought most of the posts from the former site here - but I did do some "Spring Cleaning" by removing ones that were time-related (webchats and so forth) and kept the old URL if possible.  There have been a few changes, however:

   + The URL "http://www.networkblog.net" will redirect to this site.
   + The feed URL for just the network blog is now "http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog.xml".
   + You can access just the network blog postings by browsing to "http://jeffreyrandow.org/netblog/".

Why the change?

   + Jekyll is awesome and I can stop worrying about security issues with Wordpress (it wasn't a problem, but I wanted to be a bit more secure).
   + The site is hosted on Github (Github Pages) and other content is served by a variety of CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).  Thus I can post big files and use the Google CDN to serve the file in lieu of my old cable modem connection.
   + Permanence.  Keeping the files here provides a sense of permanence.

What's Coming?

Well, at work, I am currently in a middle of a big (huge for us) deployment of new laptops to all staff.  I plan to post some of the MDT and WDS tidbits I've learned.  (the deployment was on Windows 8.1 on the new boxen and Windows 7 on the old)  I'm also looking into an awesome networking security product that is free (PacketFence).  I'm also going to post my code for a MAPI utility that you can use to add a mailbox into someone's Outlook Profile as a part of a logon script.

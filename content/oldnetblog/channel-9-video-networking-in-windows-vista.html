<p>From <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/15.html#a11171">Scoble&#8217;s</a> blog:</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=116349">video</a> has been uploaded to Channel 9 that discusses some of the networking changes in Windows Vista (IPV6, security, etc.).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get a chance tomorrow to look at the new interim build of Vista (I started downloading at the office) to see some of the other changes have been made.  I hope Castle has finally made it into one of these builds&#8230;</p>

Joseph Davies (of the Windows Server Networking team and also known as the Cable Guy) has recently released a new online book entitled <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/evaluate/technol/tcpipfund/tcpipfund.mspx">TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows</a> that is available on Technet.


From Joseph&#8217;s posting on the server networking newsgroup:


<blockquote>This online book is a structured, introductory approach to the basic<br />
concepts and principles of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet<br />
Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite, how the most important protocols function,<br />
and their basic configuration in the Microsoft® Windows Server® 2003 and<br />
Windows® XP operating systems.


This online book is available for free and provides a central location for<br />
an existing or aspiring Windows network administrator to get a comprehensive<br />
view of TCP/IP protocols and services in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.<br />
Unlike many other introductory TCP/IP book, this book provides an integrated<br />
discussion of both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol<br />
version 6 (<acronym title="Internet Protocol - Version 6">IPv6</acronym>).

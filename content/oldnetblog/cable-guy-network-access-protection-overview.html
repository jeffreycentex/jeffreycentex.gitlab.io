<p>This month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cgarch.mspx">Cable Guy</a> article is an overview of <acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> (Network Access Protection), which stands for Network Access Protection.  <acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> is set to be included &#8220;server&#8221;-wise in the Longhorn Server release (parts of it was supposed to be in R2, but they were dropped a few months back), and client wise in Windows XP and Longhorn.</p>
<p><acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> will allow you to quarantine computers (either local OR remote) that don&#8217;t meet a security profile (i.e., patch level, virus definitions, etc) from your secured network.  This should be MUCH easier to set up than the current Quarantining features contained in Windows 2003 and refined in R2.</p>
<p>As a manager of a network in a mid-sized business, this feature has been long sought after.  I was kinda disappointed when the preliminary <acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> support was removed from R2, thus forcing a two year delay in deployment.</p>

<p>Just a quicknote to people who are upgrading their Toshiba tablet PCs from the Toshiba customized version of Tablet PC OS to Windows Vista build 5472.  <strong>MAKE SURE THAT YOU EITHER BACKUP OR IMAGE YOUR HARDDRIVE!!!!</strong></p>
<p>After upgrading, I get a BSOD immediately and haven’t gotten around to figuring out which software component is causing the problems.</p>
<p>Clean installs work well (if only Toshiba would update their utility programs!).</p>

I missed the posting for the new Cable Guy article at Technet: 


Configuring Routing and Remote Access for RADIUS Authentication and Accounting

I actually met the technical writer for the Networking Team who writes the Cable Guy articles (as well as authoring some excellent networking books for <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Press) today at the product group drill down day (MVP Summit).  Pretty interesting guy&#8230;

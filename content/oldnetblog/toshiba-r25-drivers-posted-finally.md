Toshiba has finally posted Vista drivers for the Toshiba M7 and R25 tablets - a month and a half late.  What is frustrating about this is that these are the same drivers posted for the other Toshiba tablets (for the most part) early last month.  Why did it take so long, Toshiba?


The R25 and M7 lines are still discontinued.  And I will still no longer consider a Toshiba for a future tablet/laptop purchase.  I'm looking at the Lenovo or the Fujitsu T4215 for the future.  Even the new Motion shown at <a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/MotionLE1700TabletPCSpecsFoundOnFCC.aspx">GottaBeMobile</a> looks interesting.


Also note that Vista drivers apparently have been released for the <a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/ToshibaReleasesVistaDriversForM200.aspx">Toshiba M200</a>.  I know of one person at my office who would be happy about that one.

In my extended absence, I failed to note that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nap"><acronym title="Network Access Protection">NAP</acronym> (Network Access Protection) (Network Access Protection) Team</a> at <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nap/archive/2006/05/04/590467.aspx">blog</a>..


This is my most anticipated feature in Vista/Longhorn Server (note my <a href="http://www.networkblog.net/archives/2004/11/rant-lamenting-the-delay-for-network-access-protection-in-r2/">disappointment </a>that it wasn&#8217;t included in R2, but I completely understand why the decision was made).


This will be a boon for small/mid-sized business who as of today do not have an affordable solution to protect networks from rogue laptops and wireless connections..


(Edited to add the link I forgot to include&#8230; )

<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tonyso">Tony Soper</a> has a pretty good list of <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tonyso/archive/2005/08/18/409429.aspx">Patch Management Best Practices</a> resources.  In light of the recent Zotob explosion, it makes sense to bone up on some of the different patch management techniques.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we weren&#8217;t hit at all at my office.  I would like to say it is because I always keep all of the desktops completely up-to-date with patches (unfortunately, not true), but it is due to the fact that I don&#8217;t have any non-XP machines left on the network (save the two BSD boxen that act as a firewall and mail filter gateway).  However, this latest outbreak made me go back and take the time to check out the security of each machine (and to update WUS for our client machines).</p>

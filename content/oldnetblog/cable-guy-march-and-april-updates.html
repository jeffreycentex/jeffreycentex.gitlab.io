<p>In my (recurring) downtime, I missed the past two magnificient Cable Guy articles.  </p>
<p>In March:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cg0305.mspx">Troubleshooting IPV6</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This article describes the techniques and tools that you can use to help identify a problem at successive layers of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol stack that is using an Internet Protocol version 6 (<acronym title="Internet Protocol - Version 6">IPv6</acronym>) Internet layer in Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2), or Windows Server 2003.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cg0405.mspx">Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 Behavior When Connected to Both Wired and Wireless Networks</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This article describes how computers running Microsoft® Windows® XP or Windows Server™ 2003 behave when they have simultaneous connectivity to both wired and wireless networks. This article also describes workarounds for ensuring either that only one network adapter is active at any one time, or that the majority of the network traffic flows over the desired network adapter.</p>

<p>OK, this is a new section that I will add to address networking issues that are commonly "searched".</p>
<p>AKA:  This section will detail topics that keep popping up in my logs as "Search Terms".</p>
<p>For the first one, I will respond with information on a LLTD Responder client for Windows XP Professional workstations.</p>
<p>From the KB article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Network Map in Windows Vista makes network diagrams of the connections between network devices that can be used to troubleshoot connectivity problems. Network Map uses a discovery protocol called Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) that queries other devices on the network to determine how the network is organized.</p>
<p>Windows Vista includes the software components that implement the LLTD protocol. For other devices on the network to be displayed on the map, they must enable a discovery protocol that can respond to the mapping requests from the Windows Vista-based computer.</p></blockquote>

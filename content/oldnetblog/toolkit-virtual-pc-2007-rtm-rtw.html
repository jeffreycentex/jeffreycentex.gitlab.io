<p>OK, I'm late on this one (like usual), but here it goes:</p>
<p>Virtual PC 2007 has been released for download <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=04D26402-3199-48A3-AFA2-2DC0B40A73B6&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>Virtual PC is available free for Windows XP and Vista Boxes (note the limitations on which versions are "supported").  I haven't seen any downloads for the Virtual PC Tools for Unix variants, but they have been available (in a beta form) from Connect.</p>
<p>For more information, see the full Virtual PC site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/virtualpc/default.mspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also note that a newer version of VMWare Workstation (+ Player) was posted recently that provides better Vista support on both the client and the "server" side.  Go to <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> for more information.</p>

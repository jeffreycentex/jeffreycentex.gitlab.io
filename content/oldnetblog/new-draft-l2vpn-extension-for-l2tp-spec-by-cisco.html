<p>It seems Cisco has submitted a new draft spec for L2VPN extension for L2TP&#8230;   I&#8217;ll put this aside for future reading&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-l2tpext-l2vpn-02.txt">L2VPN Extensions for L2TP</a></p>
<blockquote><p>   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a standard method for<br />
   setting up and managing L2TP sessions to tunnel a variety of L2<br />
   protocols.  One of the reference models supported by L2TP describes<br />
   the use of an L2TP session to connect two Layer 2 circuits attached<br />
   to a pair of peering LACs, which is a basic form of Layer 2 Virtual<br />
   Private Network (L2VPN).  This document defines the protocol<br />
   extensions for L2TP to set up different types of L2VPN in a unified<br />
   fashion.</p>

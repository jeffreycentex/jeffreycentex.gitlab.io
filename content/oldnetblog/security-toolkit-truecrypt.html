<p>It&#8217;s about time for me to add to the Network Toolkit series of postings&#8230;.  This time, however, it is more a &#8220;security&#8221; item.</p>
<p>Some of you may have already found this tool as it has been around for a while now.  I used it more frequently in the past, but stopped when Windows XP 64 bit Edition was released since this product wasn&#8217;t compatible with x64-based Windows at that time.  However, they have updated the product recently to support x64 machines AND many of the linux variants.</p>
<p>The product is called TrueCrypt and is available for downloading <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">here</a>.  This software package is ideal for securing <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> flash drives (especially when you save personal data on them).  Then encryption technology is pretty top-of-the-line and is fairly easy to use (I taught someone at the office who carried their tax records on a 256MB <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> drive who is fairly computer illiterate how to use TrueCrypt in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Note that this software has many solutions depending on how paranoid you are about securing your data.</p>

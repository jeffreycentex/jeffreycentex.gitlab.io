<p>For readers of my past Windows Vista and Toshiba drivers, please note the following:</p>
<p><strong>TOSHIBA WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING EITHER THE TOSHIBA TECRA M7 OR THE SATELLITE R25 TABLET PC FOR WINDOWS VISTA.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, their site states that both of these models do support Vista and both machines carry the Vista Capable label.  In fact, during the beta cycle, Toshiba made drivers available for Windows Vista for the M7 (and the R25, since they are virtually identical).</p>
<p>So where do we go now?</p>
<p>Other Toshiba country units have made drivers available, but these are older ones and virtually match the beta drivers from early December 2006.  Also, the BIOS update has disappeared completely (3.10 for the M7 and the R25).</p>
<p>My solution?</p>
<p>I have been picking parts of drivers from the Tecra M4 and the Portege M400 - choosing the latest versions when possible.  The key drivers are the Toshiba Value Added Package for Windows Vista, the Tablet PC Extensions, the Fingerprint software, and the SD Card drivers.  With these, you will have a functioning system without any missing device drivers.  I would encourage you to download the applicable video drivers (Intel for the R20/R25 and some of the M7 units and Nvidia for the rest of the M7 units).</p>
<p>The only thing that is missing is the 3.10 BIOS update.  I have the M7/R25-Intel version of this BIOS update, but the M7-Nvidia version is history unless someone else has saved it.</p>
<p>What is intolerable about the situation is that Toshiba claims that Vista is not supported on these devices and that no drivers will ever be made available (per three phone calls with Toshiba tech support).  What makes the situation even more infuriating is that Toshiba IS supporting other older Tablet PC models like the Tecra M4 and Satellite R15, which were never meant to be Vista capable.</p>
<p>So keep this in mind if you are in the market for a Tablet PC.  (i.e., my next tablet will probably be Fujitsu or Lenovo and I will not recommend Toshiba to others).</p>

<p>OK, this is a bit late, but as of last week, the beta of Virtual PC 2007 is available if you want to sign up at the <a href="http://www.networkblog.net/connect.microsoft.com">Connect</a> website.</p>
<p>Not too much different except for the fact that hardware virtualization works if you are using the 64-bit version of Virtual PC on a 64-bit OS.  This version doesn't excite me too much.  <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2006/05/microsoft-shows-windows-hypervisor.html">Hypervisor</a>, on the other hand, will be impressive (Hypervisor is the virtualization "base" that will be included with Longhorn Server).  Well, that and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=66193">System Center Virtual Machine Manager</a>, which will bring much of the Virtual Server world more in line with the ESX server crowd.</p>
<p>My wish to the Virtual PC/Virtual Server group (and yes, I made this suggestion when I met with y'all just more than a week ago) - make importing of VMWare images easier.  There is a library of pre-built <a href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/">VMWare appliances</a> available at the VMTN site, but none like this for the Virtual PC/Virtual Server side.  There is nothing stopping them from being created other than time.  That's why I must use VMWare Server at work - I don't have to take the time to create environments (this being on the non-Windows side - I have standard Windows 2K3 and XP images available).</p>
<p>Enough rambling for now...</p>

First of several quick updates:


The Beta 3 release of Longhorn Server has been released and is available for download on Connect...


Unfortunately, there is still nothing on the (immediate) horizon in regards to hypervisor, but one can hope..  :(


Also, the IIS 7 team is making a Go Live license available.  More at the <a href="http://www.iis.net/articles/view.aspx/Explore-IIS7/Whats-New-in-Longhorn-Server-Beta-3?tabid=1">IIS blog</a>...

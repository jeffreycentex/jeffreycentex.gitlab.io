From an email: 


<blockquote>WiSSH is a new client that allows you to access Remote Desktop servers (running on Windows XP Pro) over a <acronym title="Secure SHell">SSH</acronym> tunnel.. Due to the way that Remote Desktop was architected in Windows XP, the standard tunneling procedure won&#8217;t work when you try to use Remote Desktop over a <acronym title="Secure SHell">SSH</acronym> tunnel. Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 Server do not exhibit this problem. 


WiSSH allows access through the Gateway <acronym title="Secure SHell">SSH</acronym> server to Windows 2000 Terminal Servers, Windows 2003 Terminal Servers, Windows NT Terminal Server Edition, Windows XP with Remote Desktop enabled, and Windows 2000/2003 Servers with Remote Administration enabled.

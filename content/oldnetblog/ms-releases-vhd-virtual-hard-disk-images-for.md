OK, there was a new surprise this morning when looking at the Downloads site at Microsoft...


Pre-built Virtual Server VHD Images...


The posted builds are for ISA Server, Exchange Server 2007 + Office LCS 2007, Windows 2003 R2, and SQL Server 2007.  This is a good start.  Now if only they would encourage the formation of a library of pre-built VHD images like what VMWare has on the VMTN site.


System requirements mention the need for Virtual Server 2005 R2, but I am making an "guesstimate" that it would probably work OK in Virtual PC 2007.  I'll test that supposition later tonight if my download finishes (don't get me started on my very sub-standard DSL connection...)

<p>From a mailing list that I am a member of:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dude network monitor is a new application by MikroTik which can dramatically improve the way you manage your network enviroment. It will automatically scan all devices within specified subnets, draw and layout a map of your networks, monitor services of your devices and alert you in case some service has problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tool is pretty cool for what it does.Â  And best of all (for those of us who are value conscious) - it is free!</p>

<p>George Ou (who runs an informative blog if you have never visited it before) has an article about the nexgen hacking tools for cracking wireless networks&#8230;  He also includes a list of best management practices to help keep your wireless network as secure as possible.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/index.php?p=20">here</a> for the article.</p>
<p>One concern that I have is that hardware manufacturers are slow to update device firmware to support more secure technologies.  Fortunately for me, my WAPs that I have deployed in my office are using WPA with AES encryption.  Over the Christmas break, I will be replacing our firewall system with one built with IPCOP, including a more limited wireless network that will force users to <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> into the internal network.  Aaarrggghhh..  Sometimes the battles we fight as net and sysadmins can be challenging.</p>

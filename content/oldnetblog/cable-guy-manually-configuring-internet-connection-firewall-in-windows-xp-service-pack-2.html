<p>OK..ï¿½ I missed this article during my extended absence&#8230;  The February Cable Guy article is about how to configure ICF that is proposed to be included in XP SP2&#8230; In general, I find the ICF included in the SP2 builds I have seen to be excellent and I use them all the time, even while operating on a network (due to the fact that you can allow packets from the local subnet to pass through while blocking foreign traffic. )</p>

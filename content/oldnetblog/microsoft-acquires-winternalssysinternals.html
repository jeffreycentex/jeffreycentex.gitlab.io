<p>From the news stack:</p>
<p>Microsoft acquired the small Austin company <a href="http://www.networkblog.net/www.winternals.com">Winternals</a> (maker of ERD Commander and numerous other Administrator utilities we have come to know and love) and have named Mark Russinovich as Technical Fellow in the Platforms and Services Division and Bryce Cogswell has joined the Windows Component Platform Team.</p>
<p>What will become of tools like ERD Commander?  Will it be merged into a new recovery tool that <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> has promised for Vista/Longhorn?</p>
<p>The excellent SysInternals tools available at <a href="http://www.networkblog.net/www.sysinternals.com">www.sysinternals.com</a> apparently will remain free for users.</p>
<p>I think we will be hearing more about this in the future.</p>

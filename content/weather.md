My weather station consists of a Vantage Pro2 Wireless Weather Station mounted in an open field adjacent to my house located on County Line Road at the eastern "high" point of the City of New Braunfels. This station replaces a Oregon Scientific WMR-100 I used temporarily after my original Vantage Pro Wireless died earlier this year. My original station was a Davis Instruments One-Wire-Weather station that is still mounted at the site, albeit covered with ivy and other vines at this time.

My weather is posted online to Weather Underground (the page most of you were visiting before coming here), the APRS (amateur radio network) system, to my upcoming New Braunfels Weather site (not online yet), and to the CWOP program (a part of the APRS system, but for ordinary citizens instead of amateur radio operators).

**<u>Background</u>**

By trade, I am both a computer geek and a civil engineer. In actuality, my civil engineering experience is primarily in hydrology, hydraulics, and other environmental engineering endeavors. I have had an interest in weather since I was a young child. In fact, my worst fear is being struck by lightning. However, I have come to appreciate the awesome power of nature.

I am also a trained NWS spotter and have attended numerous weather spotting classes held by the National Weather Service and the Texas Floodplain Management Association, of which I am a member (and currently pursuing CFM - Certified Floodplain Manager - status).

If you have any questions concerning weather, or anything weather/engineering/flooding-related, please feel free to contact me using the links above. Thanks for visiting.

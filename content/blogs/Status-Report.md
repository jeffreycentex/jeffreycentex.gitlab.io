This will be a *sticky* post that I will update as I change things on the site.

As of May 12, 2014, I have finished the following:

+   Imported all of the old postings from Wordpress and migrated them to the new system.
+   Implemented Blog Roll.
+   Got MediaElements.JS to finally cooperate.
+   Photo Galleries online.
+   Set up GDrive CDN

Work to be done:

+   Finish Templating (Author)
+   Twitter Card
+   Open Graph
+   Collections

This has been a fun project.  It has taught me a lot about HTML 5 and made me appreciate Ruby to at least a small extent.

### May 18, 2014 Update

I did a little cleanup on the site and have started to implement banners on certain post types (See any of the music postings).  I still need to tweak it some, though.  I haven't spent any time on the site the last week except for this morning.

### June 15, 2014 Update

This is a catchup post.  The site now supports Tags and Archive pages [(See this Post)](http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/05/30/Tag-Support/).  This means that I  can't completely run this on Github Pages, but it is very easy to implement and still use Github Pages.

I'm in need of finding an Accountability Partner for multiple things (one person could satisify both needs).  I need someone to kick my butt to help me keep down on the fitness path - someone who won't take my excuses when I hurt too much or just don't want to do the things that I need to do.  I promise I'll provide the same support to my accountability partner.

The second need is keeping more with the traditional role of the Accountability Partner.  Someone who can keep me following the straight and narrow path.  I have been plagued with thoughts that I should not be thinking.  I have said things that I definitely should not have said.  Like I've said before, I'm a single guy who is still incredibly weak.  The problem I have is that there aren't enough other single guys at church who can satisfy this role for me.  There are married guys, but it's hard to reciprocate as an accountability partner with some one who is married because I don't understand or know their perspective of life.

So if you are in need of an accountability partner, feel free to contact me and we can talk.

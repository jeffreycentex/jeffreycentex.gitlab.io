This is the first of a few postings in the coming days..  First, consider me kicked for taking so long to post (almost 2 full months since my last post).  I'll also be doing my first video log entry as a Christmas video that I will be linking to when I (finally) send out Christmas cards later this week (all are relatively local, so it shouldn't be a big deal to get at their destination in a reasonable amount of time).  Third, I have a relatively serious post that will go up in a day or two entitled "What I want for Christmas..." - this post will be somewhat different that what you might expect.

So what has happened in the past two months?  The following:

+ Had a BAD sinus infection at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday that bummed me out for a long time.
+ Met a former HS classmate and had a wonderful evening with her...
+ Took an Aggie with me to the Texas A&M football game...
+ Getting caught up and then getting behind again at the office.
+ Had Thanksgiving out in Zorn.  That probably means I will go to Sugarland for Christmas, but my upcoming schedule hasn't been set.
+ Finally went to IKEA in Round Rock...
+ Played in a quartet for Wassailfest...
+ Finally did the S.T.A.G.E. performance.  In my six plus years in the Comal Community Band, I have always flaked on the STAGE performance.  Don't know why...

As for my recovery, I still have bad days...  I guess that will continue for years, but hopefully with more good days than bad days.  I'm in the process of change, but it will definately take time..

Enough for now..  Check back soon for more postings..

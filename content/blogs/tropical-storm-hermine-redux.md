My official total as of 8 AM Wednesday morning is 6.89 inches of total rainfall.  We are expecting more this afternoon.

This is an excerpt of an email I sent to my office staff:

In the (immediate) aftermath of Tropical Storm Hermine, I thought you might like to know the total precipitation that has fallen as a result of this storm.  This data was obtained by individuals using high accuracy manual rain gauges and are part of the CoCoRaHS network (Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network) – I’m station TX-CML-38.  The graphs below indicate the total precipitation recorded in the prior 24 hour period.  For the purpose of determining the total rainfall, add up the two values from both maps.

Additional data like this is available at [http://cocorahs.org/Maps/ViewMap.aspx](http://cocorahs.org/Maps/ViewMap.aspx) for different counties and different days.

On October 18, 2014, I participated in the 51st Annual Longhorn Alumni Band Reunion at the Texas vs Iowa State.  This was the first time I have participated in the last 10 years (I used to always do it from 1995-2002, but dropped out afterwards).  This completes one item from my Ultimate Quest List for 2014-2015 (see [The Road Ahead](http://jeffreyrandow.org/2014/09/28/the-road-ahead-(cnf-part-2)/) for more information on the Ultimate Quest).

For this event, I decided to do a couple of videos.  Three of the videos are from me and two are from other people.  I also have a [photo gallery](https://picasaweb.google.com/105235561941690126130/LonghornAlumniBand2014) posted at Picasa (and available from the menu above).

Also note that the videos were **not** made with a GoPro.  I used my simple camera which does film in HD mode.  This camera was mounted to my tuba with a flexible camera mount.  I was surprised at how stable it was.  Either that, or I remembered how to keep my upper body stable.

The first video is what halftime looks like from my perspective.  I was on the North 15 Yard Line leading a curl from the East sideline.  **Note for those of you who have never experienced marching band, the phasing issues you hear while I am marching is common and due to how sound echoes back in the stadium.  At first, it seems disorienting, but you do get used to it.**

What was funny is that I was not the only person to do this.  A snare drummer also strapped a camera on and video taped halftime.  I say this is funny because we were on the same line and I can see him and his camera from my video and he can see me and my camera from his.  So here is his video for comparison:

The next video was the march from Music Building East to the Stadium including the Ramp Climb from hell.

The next video was my recording of the Longhorn Band Pre-Game show.  Please excuse my "sucky" singing.  Not used to people actually singing Deep in the Heart of Texas.

The final video is of the entire halftime show taken by someone in the crowd.

Will I do it again?  Yes.  I had fun.  It was good exercise.  I will try to get more people that I know to go too...

Yes, as I promised I have (or will have) posted more photos from my family - primarily of my mother and father - and most from before my time.  For the memorial service, I picked a smattering of photos for the viewing.  However, I missed the "treasurelode" of pictures contained in a different bedroom and closet that I think are much better.  So please reminisce over these photos and help fill in the blanks on when and where some of these places were.  I will cherish the memories.

The family photo album will be found in the Picasa Photo Stream listed in the menu above. And if you have more photos, please forward them on to me and I will scan and post them for all to see.

Thank you.

OK, my initial plan of posting weekly went the way of the dodo-bird.  It's been a hectic month and I have only since gotten my head above the water.  Also, I have been waiting until the 0.19 release of Hugo is available because it will fix the 404 error pages on my Categories and Tag pages (already tested locally, but I don't want to overload Gitlab so much by compiling a dev version of Hugo on every update).

I have been working out doors most weekends whenever it wasn't raining.  I've been alternating weeks of getting much from Comal County and fill/garden dirt from NB Stone Supply.  So I used the much and the garden mix to build my Onion/Garlic (aka Allium) garden.  This will be a permanent place for the garlic and the multiplying onions.

In the InfoSec world, I've been working on my Android and Windows Malware Project 3 for class.  I've also been working on a post describing encrypted messaging tools (Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc).  I also have an upcoming posting on how to setup a NGINX proxy box that does automatic LetsEncrypt certificaates (the Synology method sucked, so I rolled my own).  Also - it would probably be a good idea to change your passwords due to the news that Google was able to find a second way to create a specific SHA-1 hash.  SHA-1 is still used in a lot of password authentication system, so many of them are still affected by this bug.  Also CloudBleed...  Fortunately I avoided a bullet there as I was thinking about using Cloudflare in front of this host.  But alas, I couldn't give up domain control for this website to Cloudflare because of all of the dynamic DNS subhosts.

In the fitness world, I'm a major slacker.  I need for my accountability buddy to kick my butt.  In a big way.  I haven't been to the gym much, and I've only hit my revised step goal of 11,000 every other day (I sleep on the alternate day).

As you may or may not have noticed, all of my old content here has been removed.  Just over a month ago, a traumatic event happened in my life - the passing away of my mother due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).  As some of you know, I was her caregiver for the past six years since the first diagnosis of COPD.  This has caused many ups-and-downs in my life.  This loss has left a gaping hole in by existence - one that I am still in the process of recovering from.

As a result of all of this recent turmoil in my life, I have felt that it would be better to just start over and get a fresh perspective on everything - both in real life and in my online world. The road will be tough and long, but I feel that I will be better once I work my way through my grief and loneliness.

I feel that a fitting quote is one that I included with my sympathy thank you cards:

> Life is but a stopping place,
> A pause in what's to be,
> A resting place along the road,
> To sweet eternity.

> We all have different journeys,
> Different paths along the way,
> We are all meant to learn some things,
> But never meant to stay.

> Our destination is a place,
> Far greater than we know,
> For some the journey's quicker,
> For some the journey's slow.

> But when the journey finally ends,
> We'll claim a great reward,
> And find an everlasting peace,
> Together with the Lord.

As I follow the new pathways of life, I am a changed person.  So much in my life has changed considerably in the past month and a half.  I would like to thank you for your thoughts and prayers and keep praying that I find the right path to follow.

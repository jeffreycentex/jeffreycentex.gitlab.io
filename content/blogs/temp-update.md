I have not forgotten about the blog.  I've been busy with school and work, and also am attempting to move the blog from Jekyll to either Pelican (Python) or Hugo (Go).  I'm much more familiar with those languages than I am with Ruby (Jekyll).

I've also had to make an update to move my audio and graphical assets away from google storage to Amazon S3.  My audio may get moved again if the download of the files will cause a great increase in cost.  I'll update soon.

Thanks.

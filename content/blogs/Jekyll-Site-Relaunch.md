I am currently in the process of relaunching my personal blog from Wordpress to a
static publishing engine named "Jekyll".  This entails a major design shift and I
am rearchitecting my data to be cloud hosted (using Google Drive as a CDN - Content
Delivery Network - for my concert MP3's and other larger/hosted files) with the
base site running on Github Pages (though I could also host it on Amazon S3,
Rackspace Cloud, or even CloudFlare).

Why am I doing this?  Wordpress rocks as a website engine and I'm currently using it
to do a web page re-write for my office.  But for my personal needs, it is way too
bloated and overkill for what I need.  Plus I can now pretty much leave the site
and not worry about security (since it is all static html).

Why Jekyll?  At first, I was planning on using Pelican, but it is extremely inflexible
about using your custom URLs.  Yes, I know you can force it, but it was not very elegant.
Besides, I also just wanted to host the file and not have to worry about building it
myself.  Why not Ghost?  See my reasonings for Wordpress above, and I dislike using
Javascript as a language (Ghost uses Node.JS) and would like to see it's early demise.
(Yeah, I know, I'm using plenty of Javascript on this site, but that doesn't mean that
I have to like it).

What should you get?  Faster loading.  A more cohesive appearance.

What do I get?  A chance to code.  I primarily use Python and shell/Powershell scripting
now-a-days and need to keep up my code chops.  Plus, at this rate, I'll have Ruby
down pat soon.

I'd like to make a shout out to [Jordan Thornquest](http://www.jordanthornquest.com) who provided
me with the base theme that I have forked and added on to.  I still have lots to do to
bring the site completely back onine (I'm going to add banner pictures, make more
category pages, and stuff like that), but I have to correct all of the old content
migrated over from Wordpress.  I have half a mind to convert most of it over to
Markdown from HTML, but that will be on a time available basis.

Anywho, that is enough for now.  More work tomorrow.

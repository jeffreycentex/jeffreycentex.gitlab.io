OK, I have a quick update...  I've moved the server once again - this time to my home.  I have finally been able to upgrade from my original 384K DSL to a more modern 3 MB/512KB with a static IP address, so I should be able to host from home again.  Things might be a bit slower, but I haven't noticed many issues during the "beta" phase of the transition.

I've also updated the software and softened the look.  Let me know what you think.

More later this weekend.

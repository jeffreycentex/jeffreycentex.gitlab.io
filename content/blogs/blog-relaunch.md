This posting launches the new and improved "Jeffreys Ruminations".  The previous blog was kept offline for so long because I was no longer able to generate new pages in Jekyll (the static site generator on the old site).  I have since rewritten the entire site from scratch complete with my own new theme based on Bootstrap 3 for the Hugo Static Site Generator program.  This has been a fun project and a learning experience for both HTML5/CSS3 and Hugo.  Most of the old URL's should work, but I did retire a few pages.  Everything that was on my old Network Blog (networkblog.net) has been migrated with the original URLs, but I added a warning that the content is woefully out-of-date and is available for continuity purposes only.


I do plan on posting on both personal as well as technical content.  One focus that I will have is on online privacy in communication and security of networking devices.  I'm planning on adding Note pages for resources - Security, Dev, Python, and life hacking.  More on life with high-functioning autism.  More on my fitness journey.  And just some regular "stuff" that I may sometimes post on Facebook or Social Media.  Just a little of everything.  And more concert videos/music.  I have a backlog of about 5 concerts that I will be processing over the next couple of days.  I hope you like the new playback experience that I've added.


Thank you all for your support over the years.

> No MP3's are available for this concert.  I didn't release the hold button for the first part of the concert and the second half was ruined by the sounds of the fountain.  (Well, I could post them, but there would be a very loud water noise throughout the entire concert.)  I don't think there was anywhere else where I could have put the recorder to avoid it.  Sorry guys.  :(

The Comal Community Band will be performing for the Seguin Central Park Concert in the Park series on Sunday, June 1, 2014 starting at 7 PM Central.

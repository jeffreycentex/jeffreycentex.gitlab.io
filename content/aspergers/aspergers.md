OK, It has been a while since I have posted.  Many things have taken place since the start of this year, including:

+ The start of a new semester at school.  I am taking Data Structures (C+ + ), Discrete Mathematics 2, and Assembly Language (MIPS-32).  I may be on par to finish my certificate by the end of this year, then off to get a MS degree starting next year (while working full-time at that point).

+ I've regressed on my blood clot.  My INR has been down lately for no reason that I can see.  So I'm on a frequent testing rotation until it gets stable.  My urological issue remains unsteady, but I feel it will always be undecided on how I'm doing.

+ Last week I visited the counseling center at school and took a battery of psychological tests. Apparently I suffer from a form of high functional autism called Asperger's Syndrome.  Now that I've read the different symptoms of this syndrome, it is very obvious that I meet most of the symptoms and have met them throughout my life (even using the new not-yet-to-be-published DSM-V guidelines).  For most people, this type of diagnosis can be a crushing blow.  In my case, I have had to learn how to accommodate the difference in the way that my brain is wired and have learned  how to interact in a bare-minimum fashion with other people.  As such, the diagnosis was a relief to me in that I now understand many of the weird idiosyncrasies that I shared with no one else that I knew.For those who don't know what the base symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome, it can be basically broken down to having several of the following:
   + Limited empathy towards others (It's not that I don't have empathy, but it doesn't happen automatically)

   + Unsteady gait, balance, coordination issues

   + Lack of noticing verbal and non-verbal clues from others

   + Communications difficulties with other (i.e., due to taking most concepts literally, not being able to look at people in the eyes, not picking up social cues in conversations, etc)

   + Intense interest in certain topics, especially those dealing with math, science, engineering, and technology.

   + Detail oriented - Finding details/patterns or arriving at especially unique solutions to problems.

   + Late Speech Development

   + Dislike physical contact

   + Extremely good long term memory, terrible short term memory

   + Difficulty in reading emotions in others.

There are many more symptoms, but these are the key ones in my diagnosis.

There are many online quizzes out there that can give you a quick analysis, but still you need a professional analysis to be sure.

For me, my score on the most comprehensive of the tests is as follows:

Your Aspie score: 170 of 200

Your neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 25 of 200

You are very likely an Aspie

I guess that is it for now.  I have two concerts that I need to process and post, but that will be next weekend at the earliest.  Have a great week.

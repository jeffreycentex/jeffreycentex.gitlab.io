**Background:**

Hello.  Thank you for visiting my Resume and C.V. page.  I am currently employed as a developer, IT, and infosec person for the San Antonio Kidney Disease Center in San Antonio, TX.  I have been employed at SAKDC since 2013 after a 18 month stint as a contract worker while I was obtaining my Computer Science certificate.  Prior to this position, I was employed as an engineer in San Antonio for sixteen years.  

I have as Bachelor of Science Degree from the University of Texas at Austin (May 1990) as an Engineer.  In 2013, I recieved a Certificate for Computer Science from Texas State University.  I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology (OMSCS) with an expected graduation in 2018.  I am also employed as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the OMSCS Computer Networking and Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems (GIOS) class.  

I was designated a Microsoft MVP for Windows Networking between 2001 to 2006. My status was discontinued due to a lack of time caused by explosive growth at my former employer and due to family medical issues that required an extended amount of time  ([Microsoft MVP Letter of Recommendation][]).  I am currently a member of the MVP Reconnect Program.

I'm currently studying for the CEH exam.

Although I am no longer interested in Engineering, I am an inactive Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

**Status**

I am not actively seeking employment at this time, but I would listen to any possibilities.

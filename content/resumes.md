## Jeffrey's Resume and C.V.

**Background:**

I have realized that this section has been out-of-date for a long time and it is now time to bring it up-to-date.

In the past, I worked for approximately 16 years as a joint Civil Engineering Project Manager and the IT-Everything for a smallish Civil Engineering firm in San Antonio, TX.  My day-to-day engineering entailed Environmental and Water Resources Engineering, with prior experience in Commercial Development (primarily Albertson's and Lubys Restaurant, with a few school sites blended in).  My IT hat involved everything needed to make a small engineering company (up to 85 employees) function.

In 2011, I left employment as an Engineer and went back to school to make a change in my longterm career path.  In 2013, I "graduated" from Texas State University with a Certificate in Computer Science and I started attending the University of Texas at San Antonio as a Master's student in CS/Computer and Information Security.  I also now am employed as a member of the IT Staff at the business office of the San Antonio Kidney Disease Center primarily working on special projects and security efforts.

I was designated a Microsoft MVP for Windows Networking between 2001 to 2006. My status was discontinued due to a lack of time caused by explosive growth in my company at the time and due to family medical issues that required an extended amount of time. I am also a Microsoft Certified Professional.
